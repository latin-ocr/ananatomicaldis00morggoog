Of the Movements of Arteries, as seen in the Dissec-
tion ofLiving Animad.

N connection with the movements of the heart these things
Ι are further to be observed having reference to the move-
ments and pulses of the arteries:

1. At the moment that the heart contracta and when
the breast is struck, when, in short, the organ is in its state of
systole, the arteries are dilated, yield a pulse, and are in the
state of diastole. In like manner, when the right ventricle

contracte and propels its charge of blood, the pulmonary artery ’

liyfflglistended at the same time with the other arteries of the
zlwhen the left ventricle ceases to act, to contract, to pulsate,
the pulse in the arteries also ceases; further, when this ventricle
, contracte languidly, the pulse in the arteries is scarcely percep·
tible. ln like manner, the pulse in the right ventricle failing,
the pulse in the pulmonary artery ceases also.

3. Further, when an artery is divided or punctured, the blood
is seen to be forcibly propelled from the wound at the moment
the left ventricle contracts; and, again, when the pulmonary
artery is wounded, the blood will be seen spirting forth with
violence at the instant when the right ventricle contracts.

So also in fishes, if the vessel which leads from the heart to
the gills be divided, at the moment when the heart becomes
tense and contracted, at the same moment does the blood flow
with force from the divided vessel.

ln the same way, when we see the blood in arteriotomy pro-
jected now to a greater, now toa less distance, and that the
