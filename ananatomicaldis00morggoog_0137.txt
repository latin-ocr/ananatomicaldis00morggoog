ovale, from that part which regards the pulmonary vein, there is
athin tough membrane, larger than the opening, extended like
an operculum or cover ; this membrane in the adult blocking up
the foramen, and adhering on all sides, finally closes it up, and
almost obliterates every trace oi it. In the foetus, however, this
membraneis so contrived that falling loosely upon itsels, it
permits a ready access to the lungs and heart, yielding a passage
to the blood which is streaming from the cava, and hindering
the tide at the same time from flowing back into that vein. All
things, in short, permit us to believe that in the embryo the
blood must constantly pass by this foramen from the vena cava
into th‘e pulmonary vein, and from thence into the left auricle ol'
the heart3 and having once entered there, it can never regur-
· itate.

g Another union is that by the pulmonary artery, and is effected
when that vessel divides into two branches alter its escape from
the right ventricle of the heart. It is as is to the two trunks
already mentioned a third were superadded,a kind ol arterial
canal, carried obliquely lrom the pulmonary artery, to perforate
and terminate in the great artery or aorta. So that in the dis-
section of the embryo‚ as it were, two aortaS, or two roots ol the
great artery appear springing lrom the heart. This canal shrinks
gradually alter birth, and alter a time becomes withered, and
finally almost removed, like the umbilical vessels.

The arterial canal contains no membrane or valve to direct or
impede the llow os blood in this or in that direction: forat the
root ol the pulmonary artery, ol which the arterial canal is the
continuation in the foetus, there are three semilunar valves,
which open from within outwards, and oppose no obstacle to
the blood flowing in this direction or l'rom the right ventricle
into the pulmonary artery and aorta; but they prevent all re-
gurgitation irom the aorta or, pulmonic vessels back upon the
right ventricle; closing with perlect accuracy, they oppose an
effectual obstacle to everything oi the kind in the embryo. So
that there is also reason to believe that when the heart contracts,
the blood is regularly propelled by the canal or passage indicated
srom the right ventricle into the aorta.
