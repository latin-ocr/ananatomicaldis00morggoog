of the Heart and Blood. 17

conduit, I reply, that Nature is not wont to construet but one
vessel, to contrive but one way sor such contrary movements and
purposes, nor is anything ol the kind seen elsewhere.

ll sumes or fuliginous vapours and air permeate this vessel,
as they do the pulmonary bronchia, wheresore do we find neither
air nor fuliginous vapours when we divide the pulmonary vein l
Why do we always find this vessel lull os sluggish blood, never os
air, whilst in the lungs we find abundance ol air remaining?

ll anyone will perform (jalen's experiment of dividing the
trachea ol a living dog, sorcibly distending the lungs with a pair
οἱ bellows, and then tying the trachea securely, be will lind,
when he has laid open the thorax, abundance ot air in the lungs,
even to their extreme investing tunic, but none in either the
pulmonary veins, or leit ventricle os the beart. But did the heart
either attract air from the lungs, or did the lungs transmit any
air to the heart, in the living dog, much more ought this to be
the case in the experiment just referred to. Who, indeed, doubts
that, did he inflate the lungs oi a subject in the dissecting-room,
he would instantly see the air making its way by this route, were
there actually any such passage for iti But this office oi the
pulmonary veins, namely, the transference ol air from the lungs
to the heart, is held oi such importance‚ that Hieronymus Fabricius
os Aquapendcnte, contends that the lungs were made sor the sake
of this vessel, and that it constitutes the principal element in their
structure.

But I should like to be informed why, is the pulmonary vein
were destined sor the conveyance os air, it has the structure oi a
blood-vessel here. Nature had rather need of annular tubes,
such as those os the bronchia, in order that they might always
remain open, and not be liable to collapse; and that they might
continue entirely free from blood, lest the liquid should intersere
with the passage oi the air, as it so obviously does when the
lungs labour from being either greatly oppressed or loaded in a

less degree with phlegm, as they are when the breathing is
performed with a sibilous or rattling noise.

Still less is that opinion to be tolerated which, as a twolold
material, one aereal, one sanguineous, is required ior the compo·
