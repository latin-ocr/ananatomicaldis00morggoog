36 Of the Movement

demonstrated not only by many powerful arguments, but by
exbllrrtnlletlle&divine Galen will here allow, as in other places he
doeS, ‘that all the arteries of the body arise from the great artery,
and that this takes its origin from the heart 3 that all these
vessels naturally contain and carry blood ; that the three serni-
lunar valves situated at the orifice of the aorta prevent the return
of the blood into the heart, and that nature never connected
them with this, the most noble viscus of the body, unless for
some most important end ;’ if, I say, this Father of Physic con·
cedes all these things-and Ι quote his own words—I do not see
how he can deny that the great artery is the very vessel to carry
the blood, when it has attained its highest term of perfection,
frorn the heart for distribution to all parts of the body. Or
would he perchance still hesitate‚ like all who have come after
him, even to the present hour, because he did not perceive the
route by thch the blood was transferred from the veins to the
arteries, in consequence, as l have already said, of the intimate
connection between the heart and the lungs? And that this
difficulty puzzled Anatomists not a little, when in their dissec-
tions they found the pulmonary artery and left ventricle full of
thick, black, and clotted blood, plainly appears, when they felt
themselves compelled to affirm that the blood made its way
from the right to the left ventricle by percolating through the
septum of the heart. But this fancy Ι have already refuted. A
new pathway for the blood must therefore be prepared and
thrown open, and being once exposed, no further difficulty will,
lbelieve, be experienced by anyone in admitting what I have

already proposed in regard to the pulse of the heart and arteries‚
oth„ the passage ol the blood from the veins to the arterias,

and ilts distribution to the whole of the body by means of these
vesse s.
