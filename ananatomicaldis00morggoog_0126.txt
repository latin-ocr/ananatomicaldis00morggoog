28 Of the Movement

distinct in time and in place, two of which are proper to the
auricles, two to the ventricles. With all deferente to such
authority, isay that there are four movements distinct in point of
place, but not of time ; for the two auricles move together, and
so also do the two ventricles, in such wise that though the places
be four, the times are only two. And this occurs in the following
manner:

There are, as it were, two movements going on together ; one
of the auricles, another oi the ventricles; these by no means
taking place simultaneously, but the movement of the auricles
preceding, that of the beart following ; the movement appearing
to begin from the auricles and to extend to the ventricles. When
all things are becoming languid, and the heart is dying, as also
in fishes and the colder blooded animals, there is a short pause
between these two movements, so that the beart aroused, as it were,
appears to respond to the movement, now more quickly, now more
tardily ; and at length, when near to death, it ceases to respond by
its proper movement, but seems, as it were, to nod the head, and
is so slightly moved that it appears rather to give signs ol move·
ment to the pulsating auricle, than actually to move The heart,
therefore, ceases to pulsate sooner than the auricles, so that the
auricles have been said to outlive it, the left ventricle ceasing to
pulsate first of all ; then its auricle, next the right ventricle; and,
finally, all the other parts being at rest and dead, as Galen long
since observed, the right auricle still continues to beat; life,
therefore, appears to linger longest in the right auricle. Whilst
the heart is gradually dying, it is sometimes seen to reply, after
two or three contractioris of the auricles, roused as it were to
αοῒίἕη, ang making a single pulsation, slowly, unwillingly, and
wit ane ort.

But this especially is to be noted, that after the heart lias
ceased to beat, the auricles however still contracting, a finger
placed upon the ventricles perceives the several pulsations of the
auricles, precisely in the same way and for the same reason, as
we have said, that the pulses of the ventricles are felt in the
arteries, to wit, the distension produced by the jet of blood. And
if at this time, the auricles alone pulsating, the point of the beart
