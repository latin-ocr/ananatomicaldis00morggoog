UPON THE

MOVEMENT OF THE HEART
AND BLOOD IN ANIMALS.

Introduction.

S we are about to discuss the movement, action, and use
of the heart and arteries, it is incumbent upon us first
to state what has been thought of these things by
others in their writings, and what has been held by the

vulgar and by tradition, in order that what is true may be
confirmed, and what is false set right by dissection, multiplied
experience, and accurate observation.

Almost all anatomists, physicans, and philosophata, up to the
present time, have supposed, with Galen, that the object of the
pulse was the same as that of respiration, and only differed in one
particular, this being conceived to depend on the animal, the
respiration on the vital faculty; the two, in all other respects,
whether with reference to purpose or to motion, comporting
themselves alike. Whence it is affirmed, as by Hieronymus
Fabricius of Aquapendentc, in his book on ‘Respiration,' which
has lately appeared, that as the pulsation of the beart and
arteries does not suffice for the ventilation and refrigeration ol
the blood, therefore were the lungs fashioned to surround the
heart. From this it appears, that whatever has hitherto been
said upon the systole and diastole, or on the movement of the
heart and arteries, has been said with especial reference to the
lun s.
