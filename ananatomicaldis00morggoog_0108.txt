. 10 Of the Movement

those os the lungs‚ and the movements oi the arteries lrom those
ol the chest, so it seerns likely that other ends and offices will
thence arise, and that the pulsations and uses oi the heart, like-
wise os the arteries, will differ in many respects irom the heavings
and uses oi the chest and lungs. For did the arterial pulse and
the respiration serve the same ends; did the arteries in their
diastole take air into their cavities, as commonly stated, and in
their systole emit iuliginous vapours by the same pores ol' the
flesh and skin; and further, did they, in the time intermediate
between the diastole and the systole, contain air, and at all times
either air, or spirits, or iuliginous vapours, what should then be
said to (jalen. who wrote a book on purpose to show that by
nature the arteries contained blood, and nothing but blood, and
consequently neither spirits nor air, as may be readily gathered
from the experirnents and reasonings contained in the same
book? Nowii the arteries are filled in the diastole with air then
taken into them (a larger quantity os air penetrating when the
pulse is large and full), it must come to pass that if you plunge
into a bath ol water or oi oil when the pulse is strong and tull,
it ought sorthwith to become either smaller or much slower,
since the circumambient bath will render it either difficult or
impossible sor the air to penetrate. In like manner, as all the
arteries‚ those that are deep-seated as well as those that are
superficial, are dilated at the same instant, and with the same
rapidity, how is it possible that air should penetrate to the deeper
parts as treely and quickly through the skin, flesh, and other
structureS, as through the mere cuticle? And how should the
arteries os the soetus draw air into their cavities· through the
abdomen of the mother and the body os the womb? And how
should seaIS, whales, dolphins and other cetaceanS, and fishes οἰ
every description, living in the depths oi the sea, take in and
emit air by the diastole and systole os their arteries through the
infinite mass of waters? Fortu say that they absorb the air that
is present in the water, and emit their sumes into this medium,
were to utter something very like a figment. And if the arteries
in their systole expel fuliginous vapours from their cavities
through the pores of the flesh and skin, why not the spirits,
