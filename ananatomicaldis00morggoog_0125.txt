together, but by successive movements! It is well to observe
with Galen, in this place, that the old philosophers called the
arteries veins. “

l happened upon one occasion to have a particular case under
my care, which plainly satisfied me oi this truth: A certain
person was affected with a large pulsating turnour on the right
side oi the neck, called an aneurism‚ just at that part where the
artery descends into the axilla, produced by an erosion oi the
artery itseli, and daily increasing in size; this tumour was visibly
distended as it received the charge oi blood brought to it by the
artery, with each stroke ol the heart : the connection oi parts was
obvious when the body os the patient cameto be opened aster
his death. The pulse in the corresponding arm was small, in
consequence os the greater portion of the blood being diverted
into the tumour and so intercepted.

Whence it appears that wherever the movement oi the blood
through the arteries is impeded‚ whether it be by compression
or iniarction‚ or interception, there do the remote divisions oi
the arteries beat less forcibly, seeing that the' pulse oi the arteries
is nothing more than the impulse or shock ol the blood in these
vessels.
