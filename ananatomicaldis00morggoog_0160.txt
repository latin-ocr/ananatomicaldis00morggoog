62 Of the ” Movement

the veios appears plainly enough from the fact that the blood
cannot be forced towards the heart unless the ligature be
removed ; when this is done suddenly all the veios collapse, and
disgorge themselves of their contents into the superior parts, the
hand at the same time resumes its natural pale colour, the tume-
fection and the stagnating blood having disappeared.

Moreover, he whose arm or wrist has thus been bound for
some little time with the medium bandage, so that it has not
only got swollen and livid but cold, when the tillet is undone is
aware of something cold making its way upwards along with the
returning blood, and reaching the elbow or the axilla. And l
have myself been inclined to think that this cold blood rising
upwards to the heart was the cause of the fainting that often
occurs after blood-letting: fainting frequently supervenes even in
robust subjects, and mostly at the moment of undoing the tillet,
as the vulgar say, from the turning of the blood.

Further, when we see the veins below the ligature instantly
swcll up and become gorged, when from extreme tightness it is
somewhat relaxed, the arteries meantime continuing unaffected,
this is an obvious indication that the blood passes from the
arteries into the veins, and not from the veins into the arteries,
and that there is either an anastomosis of the two orders of
vessels, or pores in the flesh and solid parts generally that are
permeable by the blood. It is further an indication that the
veins have frequent communications with one another, because
they all become turgid together, whilst under the medium
ligature applied above the elbow ; and if any single small vein
be pricked with a lancet, they all speedily shrink, and dis·
burthenling themselves into this they subside almost simul-
taneous y.

These consideratioos will enable anyone to understand the
nature of the attraction that is exerted by ligatures, and per-
chance of fluxes generally; how, for example, when the veins
when compressed bya bandage of medium tightness applied
above the elbow, the blood cannot escape, whilst it still continues
to be driven in, by the forcing power of the heart, by which the
parts areos necessity filled, gorged with blood. And how
