of the Heart and Blood. 19

modiously, and without an effort, through the septum of the
ventricles, which has now become denset by age?

Andreas Laurentium* testing on the authority of (jalen† and
the experience of Hollerius, asserts and proves that the serum
and pus in empyema, absorbed from the cavities of the chest
into the pulmonary vein, may be expelled and got rid of with
the urine and faeces through the left ventricle of the heart and
arteries. He quotes the case of a certain person affected with
melancholia, and who suffered from repeated fainting fits, who
was relieved from the paroxysms on passing a quantity of turbid,
fetid, and acrid utine. But he died at last, worn out by the
disease; and when the body cameto be opened after death, no
liuid like that he had micturated was discovered either in the
bladder or in the kidneys; but in the left uentricle of the heart
and cavity of the thorax plenty of it was met with. And then
Laurentius boasts that he had predicted the cause of the
symptoms For my own part, however,I cannot but wonder,
since he had divined and predicted that heterogeneous matter
could be discharged by the course he indicates, why he could
not or would not perceive, and inform us that, in the natural
state of things, the blood might be commodiously transferred
from the lungs to the left ventricle of the heart by the very
same route.

Since, therefore, from the soregoing consideratione and many
others to the same effect, it is plain that what has heretolore been
said concerning the movement and function of the heart and

arteries must appear obscure, inconsistent or even impossible to
him who carefully considers the entire subject, it will be proper to
look more narrowly into the matter, to contemplate the movement
of the heart and arteries, not only in man, but in all animals that
have hearts3 and also, by frequent appeals to vivisection and
continual ocular inspection, to investigate and discern the truth.
