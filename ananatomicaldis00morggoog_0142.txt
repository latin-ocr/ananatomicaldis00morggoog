44 Of the Movement

and pores ο[ the lungs. And then the lungs‚ in respiration, are
perpetually rising and falling 3 movements, the effect ο[ which
must needs be to open and shut the pones and vessels, precisely
as in the case oi asponge, andos parts having a spongy structure,
when they are alternately compressed and again are suffered to
expand. The livet, οτι the contrary, remains at rest, and is never
seen to be dilated or constricted. Lastly, ii no one denies the
possibility ο[ the whole oi the ingested juices passing through
the liver, in man, oxen, and the langeranimals generally, in order
to reach the vena cava, [οτ this reason, that if nourishment is to
continue, these juices must needs get into the veins, and there
is no other way but the one indicated, why should not the same
arguments be held ο[ avail [οτ the passage ο[ the blood in 'adults
through the lungs? Why not maintain, with columbus, that
skiliul and learned Anatomist, that it must be so from the
capacity and structure ο[ the pulmonary vessels, and from the
fact of the pulmonary veins and ventricle corresponding with
thern, being always found to contain blood, which must needs
have corne from the veins, and by no other passage save
through the lungs? Columbus, and we also, from what precedes,
[τοττι dissections, and other arguments, conceive the thing to be
clear. But as there are some who admit nothing unless upon
authority, let them learn that the truth Ι am contending sor can
be confirmed [τοττι (jalen's own words, namely, that not only
may the blood be transmitted [τοττι the pulmonary artery into

the pulmonary veins, then into the leit ventricle ο[ the heart, ’

and from thence into the arteries oi the body, but that this is
effected by the ceaseless pulsation of the heart and the move·

There are, as everyone knows, three sigmoid οτ semilunar
valves situatcd at the orifice ο[ the pulmonary artery, which
effectually prevent the blood sent into thc vessel [τοττι returning
into the cavity oi the heart. Now (jalen, explaining the uses
ο[ these valves, and the necessity [οτ thern, employs the follow-
ing language ε* ‘There is everywhere a mutual anastomosis and
