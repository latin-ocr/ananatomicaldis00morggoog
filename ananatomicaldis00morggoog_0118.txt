20 Of the Movement

Chapter Ι.

The Autlmr’s Mott'ves for Writing.

ΗΕΝ Ι first gave my mind to vivisections, as a means
of discovering the movements and uses ol the heart,

ι hl and sought to discover these from actual inspection,

and not from the writings oi others, Ι found the
task so truly arduous, so full oi difficulties, that l was almost
tempted to think, with Fracastort'us, that the movement of the
heart was only to be comprehended by God. ForI could neither

not surprised that Andreas Laurentius should have written that
the movement ol the heart was as perplexing as the ilux and
reflux ol Euripus had appeared to Anttotle.

investigation‚ making frequent inspection ol many and various
animals, and collating numerous observations, Ι thought that I

views upon these subjects, not only in private to my friends, but
also in public, in my anatomical lectures, aster the manner oi the
Academy ol old.

These views, as usual, pleased some more, others less3 some
