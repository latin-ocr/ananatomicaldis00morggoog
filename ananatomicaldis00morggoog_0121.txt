are perceived to become tense and resilient when the fingers are
moved.

4 lt may further be observed in fishes, and the colder·blooded
animala, such as frogs, serpents, ἂι.. that the beart, when it
moves, becomes of a paler colour, when quiescent of a deeper
blood-red colour.

From these particulars it appeared to me evident that the
movement of the heart consists in a certain universal tension-
both contractiori in the line os its libres, and constriction in every
sense. lt becomes erect, hard, and of diminished size during its
action ; the movement is plainly of the same nature as that of the
muscles when they contract in the line of their sinews 3ηά libres;
for the muscles, when in action, acquire vigour and tenseness,
and from solt become hard, prominent and thickened: in the
same manner the beart.

We are therefore authorized to conclude that the heart, at the
moment of its action, is at once constrIcted on all sides, rendered
thicker in its parietes and smaller in its ventricles, and so made
apt to project or expel its charge of blood. This, indeed, is
made sufficiently manifest by the preceding fourth observation in
which we have seen that the heart, by squeezing out the blood
it contains becomes paler, and then when it sinks into reposeand
the ventricle is filled anew with blood, that the deeper crimson
colour returns. But no one need remain in doubt of the fact,
for if the ventricle be pierced the blood will be seen to be forcibly
projected outwards upon each movement or pulsation when the
heart is tense.

These things, therefore, happen together or at the same instant:
the tension of the beart, the pulse of its apex, which is felt
externally by its striking against the chest, the thickening of its
parietes, and the forcible expulsion of the blood it contains by the
constriction of its ventricles.

Hence the very opposite os the opinions commonly received,
appears to be true3 inasmuch as it is generally believed that
when the heart strikes the breast and the pulse is felt without,
the heart is dilated in its ventricles 3ηά is filled with blood; but
the contrary of this is the fact, and the beart, when it contracts
