who inquire into the ways by which the blood reaches the left

ventricle of the heart and pulmonary veins from the vena cava,
will pursue the wisest course if they seek by dissection to dis-
cover the causes why in the larger and more perfect animals of
mature age, Nature has rather chosen to make the blood percolate
the parenchyma of the lungs, than as in other instances chosen
a direct and obvious course-for 1 assume that no other path or
mode of transit can be entertained. It must be because the
larger and more perfect animale are warmer, and when adult
their heat greater-ignited, as 1 might say, and requiring to be
damped or mitigated, that the blood is sent through, the lungs,
in order that it may be tempered by the air that is inspired, and
prevented from boiling up, and so becoming extinguished‚ or
something else of the sort But to determine these matters, and
explain thern satisfactorily, were to enter on a speculation in ’
regard to the office of the lungs and the ends for which they
exist. Upon such a subject, as well as upon what pertains to
respiration, to the necessity and use of the air, δῖα, as also to
the variety and diversity of organs that exist in the bodies of
animals in connection with these matters, although I have made
a vast number of observations,I shall not speal( till l can more
conveniently set them forth in a treatise apart, lest Ι should be
held as wandering too wide of my present purpose, which is the
use and movement of the heart‚ and be charged with speaking of
things beside the question, and rather complicating and quitting
thanillustratingit. And now, returning to myimmediate subject,
Ι go on with what yet remains for demonstration, vra„ that in
the more perfect and warmer adult animals, and man, the blood
passes from the right ventricle of the heart by the pulmonary
artery, into the lungs, and thence by the pulmonary veins into
the left auricle, and from there into the leftventricle of the heart.

And, first, I shall show that this may be so, and then Ι shall
prove that it is so in fact.
