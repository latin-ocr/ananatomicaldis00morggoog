12 ‘ Of the Movement

Galen himself affirms in more than one place, the whole oi the
blood may be withdrawn in the course os hals an hour, or less.
The experiment of (jalen alluded to is this: ‘Ii you include a
portion ol an artery between two ligatures, and slit it open
lengthwayS, you will find nothing but blood ;’ and thus he proves
that the arteries contain blood only. And we too may be per·
mitted to proceed bya like train of reasoning: il we find the
same blood in the arteries asin the velus, after having tied them
in the same way, as I have mysels repeatedly ascertained, both
in the dead body and in living animals, we may fairly conclude

that the arteries contain the same blood as the veins, and nothing '

but the same blood. Some, whilst they attempt to lessen the
difficulty, affirm that the blood is spirituous and arterious‚ and
virtually concede that the office os the arteries is to carry blood
from the heart into the whole oi the body, and that they are
therefore filled with blood ; lor spirituous blood is not the less
blood ou that account. And no one denies that the blood as
such, even the portion of it which llows in the veins, is imbued
with spirits. But il that portion which is contained in the arteries
be richer in spirits, it is still to be believed that these spirits are
inseparable irorn the blood, like those in the veins; that the blood
and spirits constitute one body (like whey and butter in milk, or
heat in hot water), with which the arteries are charged, and lor
the distribution ol which from the heart they are provided, and
that this body is nothing else than blood. But is this blood be
said to be drawn from the heart into the arteries by the diastole
ol these vessels, it is then assumed that the arteries by their dis·
tension are filled with blood, and not with the surrounding air, as
heretosore3 lor ii they be said also to become filled with air from
the ambient atmosphere, how and when, I ask, can they receive
blood irom the heart? Is it be answered: during the systole, 1

But ii it be said: during the diastole, they would then, and sor
two opposite purposes, be receiving both blood and air, and heat
and cold, which is improbable Further, when it is affirmed that
the diastole oi the heart and arteries is simultaneous, and the
