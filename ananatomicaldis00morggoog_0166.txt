68 Of the Movement

towards the vena cava and vena portae. Let it be added that
there are no valves in the asterus, and that dogs, oxon, dxc, have
invariably valves at the divisions of their crural veins, in the
veins that meet towards the top of the os sacrum, and in those
branches which come from the haunches‚ in which no such effect
of gravity from the erect position was to be apprehended.
N either are there valves in the jugular veins for the purpose of
guarding against apoplexy, as some have said ; because in sleep
the head is more apt to be influenced by the contents of the
carotid arteries. Neither are the valves present, in order that
the blood may be retained in the divarications or smaller trunks
and minuter branches, and not be suffered to flow entirely into
the more open and capacious channels; for they occur where
there are no divarications: although it must be owned that they
are most frequent at the points where branches join. Neither
do they exist for the purpose of rendering the current of blood
more slow from tho centre of the body; for it seems likely that
the blood would be disposed to flow with sufficient slowness of
its own accord, as it would have to pass from larger into con-
tinually smaller vessels, being separated from the mass and
fountain head, and attaining from warmer into colder places.

But the valves are solely made and instituted lest the blood
should pass from the greater into the lesser veins, and either
rupture them or cause them to become varicose; lest, instead of
advancing from the extreme to the central parts of the body, the
blood should rather proceed along the veins from the centre to
the extremities; but the delicate valves, while they readily open
in the right direction, entirely prevent all such contrary movement,
being so situated and arranged, that if anything escapes, or is
less perfectly obstructed by the cornua of the one above, the .
fluid passing, as it were, by the chinks between the cornua, it is
immediately received on the convexity of the one beneath‚ which
is placed transversely with reference to the former, and so is
effectually lrindered from getting any further.

And this l have frequently experienced in my dissections of
the veins: if I attempted to pass a probe from the trunk of the
veins into one of the smaller branches, whatever care l took Ι
