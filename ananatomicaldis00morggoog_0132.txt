34 Of the Movement

Even so does it come to pass with the movements and action ol
the heart, which constitute a kind ol deglutition, a transfusion os
the blood from the veins to the arteries And is anyone, bearing
these things in mind, will careiully watch the movements ol the
heart in the body ol a living animal, he will perceive not only all
the particulars 1 have mentioned, via„ the heart becoming erest,
and making one continuous movement with its auricles; but
further,a certain obscure undulation and laterai inclination in
the direction ol the axis ol the right ventricle, as il twisting itsell
slightly in performing its work. And indeed everyone may see,
when a horse drinlrs‚ that the water is drawn in and transmitted
to the stomach at each movement oi the throat, which move·
ment produces a sound and yields a pulse both to the ear and
the touch ; in the same way it is with each movement ol the heart,
when there is the delivery os a quantity ol blood lrom the veins
to the arteries, a pulse takes place, and can be heard within the
chesi. ·

The movement os the heart, then, is entirely ol this description,
and the one action of the heart is the transmission of the blood
and its distribution, by means ol the arteries, to the very ex·
tremities ol the body; so that the pulse which we seel in the
arterielsl is nothing more than the impulse ol the blood derived
fromt eheart.

Whether or not the heart, besides propelling the blood, giving
it movement locally, and distributing it to the body, adds any·
thing else to it-heat, spirit, perfection—must be inquired into
by and by, and decided upon other grounds. So much may
suffice at this time, when it is shown that by the action ol the
heart the blood is translused through the ventricles from the
veins to the arteries, and distributed by them to all parts os the
body.

The above, indeed, is admitted by all, both from the structure
os the heart and the arrangement and action ol its valves. But
still they are like persons purblind or groping about in the dark,
· lor they give utterance to various, contradictory, and incoherent
sentiments, delivering many things upon conjecture, as we have
already shown. ¹
