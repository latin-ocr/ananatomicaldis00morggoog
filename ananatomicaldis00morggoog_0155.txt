of the Heart and Blood. 57

the reasons assigned, it appears, that by so much as the heart in
its dilated state contains in addition to its contents in the state
01 constriction, so much in a general way must it emit upon
each pulsation, 3ηά in such quantity must the blood pass, the
body being entire and naturally constituted.

But in serpents, and several fishes, by tying the veins¹ some
way below the beart, you will perceive a space between the
ligature 3ηά the heart speedily to become empty3 so that, unless
you would deny the evidence 01 your senses, you must needs
admit the return 01 the blood to the heart The same thing
will also plainly appear when we corneto discuss our second

osition.
p Let us here conclude with a single example, confirming 311
that has been said, and from which everyone may obtain con·
viction through the testimony 01 his own eyes

11 3 11ν3 snake be laid open, the heart will be seen pulsating
quietly, distinctly, ior more than an hour, moving like a worm,
contracting in its longitudinal dimensions, (ior it is 01 an oblong
shape), and propelling its contents. It becomes 01 3 paler
colour in the systole, 01 3 deeper tint in the diastole ; 3ηά almost
all things else are seen by which I have already said that the
truth 1 contend lor is established, only that here everythiug
takes place more slowly, and is more distinct. This point in
particular may be observed more clearly than the noon·day sun:
the vena cava enters the heart at its lower part, the artery quits
it at the superior part; the vein being now seized either with
forceps or between the finger and thumb, 3ηά the course 01 the
blood sor some space below the heart interrupted, you will
perceive the part that intervenes between the fingers 3ηά the
heart almost immediately to become empty, the blood being
exhausted by the action 01 the heart; at the same time the
heart will become 01 3 much paler colour, even in its state 01
dilatation, than 11 was before; it is also smaller than at first,
irom wanting blood ; and then it begins to beat more slowly, so
that 11 seems at length as 11 11 were about to die. But the
impediment to the flow 01 blood being removed, instantly the

colour and the size 01 the heart are restored. 8
