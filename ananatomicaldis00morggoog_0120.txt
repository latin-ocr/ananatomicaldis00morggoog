22 Of the Movement

Chapter II.

Of the Movements of the Heart, as seen in tlre Dissec-
tion of Lebing Animals.

N the first place, then, when the chest os a living animal is
laid open and the capsule that immediately surrounds the
heart is slit up or removed, the organ is seen now to move,
now to be at rest ;—there is a time when it moves, and a

time when it is at rest.

These things are more obvious in the colder animala, such as
toads, irogs‚ serpents, small lishes, crabs, shrimps, snails and
shell-lish. They also become more distinct in warm-blooded
animals, such as the dog and hog, if they be attentively noted
when the heart begins to flag, to move more slowly, and, as it
were, to die: the movements then become slower and rarer, the
pauses longer, by which it is made much more easy to perceive
and unravel what the movements really are, and how they are
performed. In the pause, as in death, the heart is solt, flaccid,
exhausted, lying, as it were, at rest.

In the movement, and interval in which this is aocomplished,
three principal circumstances are to be noted:

1. That the heart is erected, and rises upwards to a point, so
that at tpis time it strikes against the breast, and the pulse is selt
external y.

2. That it is everywhere contracted, but more especially
towards the sides, so that it looks narrower, relatively longer,
more drawn together. The heart ol an eel taken out ol the
body ol the animal and placed upon the table or the hand, shows
these particulars ; but the same things are manifest in the hearts
os small fishes and ol those colder animals where the organis
more conical or elongated.

3. The heart being grasped in the hand, is felt to become
harder during its action. Now this harduess proceeds from
tension, precisely as when the sorearm is grasped, its tendons
