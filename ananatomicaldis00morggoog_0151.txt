blood, it is equally so that, contracting, these cavities should

expel their contents3 and this not in any trifling measure. For
neither are the conduits small, nor the contractions lew in number,
but frequent, and always in some certain proportion‚ whether it
bea third or a sixth, or an eighth, to the total capacity ol the
ventricles, so that a like proportion oi blood must be expelled,
and a like proportion received with each stroke ol the heart, the
capacity oi the ventricle contracted always bearing acertain
relation to the capacity os the ventricle when dilated. And
since in dilating, the ventricles cannot be supposed to get filled
with nothing, or with an imaginary something, so in contracting
they never expel nothing or aught imaginary, but always a
certain something, ντὶ, blood, in proportiou to the amount ol
the contraction. Whence it is to be concluded, that ii at one
stroke the beart in man, the ox or the sheep, ejects but a single
drachm oi blood, and there are one thousand strokes in hali an
hour, in this interval there will have been ten pounds five ounces
expelled: ii with each stroke two drachms are expelled, the
quantity would oi course amount to twenty pounds and ten
ounces; ii hali an ounce, the quantity would come to iorty·one
pounds and eight ounces; and were there one ounce it would
be as much as eighty-three pounds and four ounces; the whole
oi which, in the course os one hals bour, would have been trans.-
iused lrorn the veins to the arteries. The actual quantity oi
blood expelled at each stroke ol the heart, and the circumstances
under which it is either greater or less than ordinary, Ι leave ior
particular determination afterwards, from numerous observatione
which Ι have made on the subject.

Meantime this rnuch I know, and would here proclaim to all,
that the blood is transsused at one time in larger, at another in
smaller quantity; and that the circuit oi the blood is accom-
plisbed now more rapidly, now more slowly, according to the
temperament‚ age, ἂι, ol the individual, to external and internal
circumstances, to naturals and non-naturals,-sleep, rest, l'ood,
exercise, affections oi the mind, and the like. But, supposing
even the smaliest quantity oi blood to be passed through the
heart and the lungs with each pulsation, a vastly greater amount
