30 Of the Movement

life, so that both ventricles and auricles pulsated, contracting
and relaxing alternately, recalled as it were from death to lif .

Besides this, however, Ι have occasionally observed, after the
heart and even its right auricle had ceased pulsating-when it
was in artt'culo mortis in short-that an obscure movement, an
undulation or palpitation, remained in the blood itself, which was
contained in the right auricle‚ this being apparent so long as it
was imbued with heat and spirit. And indeed a circumstance
of the same kind is extremely manifest in the course of the
generation of animals, as may be seen in the course of the first
seven days of the incubation of the chick: A drop of blood
makes its appearance which palpitates, as Aristotle had already
observed; from this, when the growth is further advanced and
the chick is fashioned, the auricles of the heart are formed,
which pulsating henceforth give constant signs of life. When
at length, and after the lapse of a few days, the outline of the
body begins to be distinguished, then is the ventricular part of
the heart also produced ; but it continues for a time white and
apparently bloodless, like the rest of the animal ; neither does it
pulsate or give signs of movement. Ι have seen a similar condi·
tion of the heart in the human foetus about the beginning of the
third month, the heart being then whitish and bloodless, although
its auricles contained a considerable quantity of purple blood.
In the same way in the egg, when the chick was formed and had
increased in size, the heart too increased and acquired ventricles,
which then began to receive and to transmit blood.

And this leads me to remark, that he who inquires very par·
ticularly into this matter will not conclude that the heart, as a
whole, is the primum vivens, ultimum monins-the first part to
live, the last to die-but rather its auricles, or the part which
corresponds to the auricles in serpents, fisheS, ἂι, which both
lives before the heart and dies after it.

N ay, has not the blood itself or spirit an obscure palpitation
inherent in it, which it has even appeared to me to retain after
death? and it seems very questionable whether or not we are
to say that life begins with the palpitation or beating of the
heart. The seminal fluid of all animals-the prolific spirit, as
