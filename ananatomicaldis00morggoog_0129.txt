of the Heart and Blood. 3¹

Artstotle observed, leaves their body with a bound and like a
living thing; and nature in death, as Aristotle* further remarks,
retracing her steps, reverts to where she had set out, and returns
at the end of her course to the goal whence she had started.
As animal generation proceeds from that which is not animal,
entity from nonentity, so, by a retrograde course, entity, by
corruption, is resolved into nonentity ; whence that in animals,
which was last created, fails first; and that which was first, faits
last.

I have also observed, that almost 311 animals have truly a
heart, not the larger creatures only, and those that have red
blood, but the smalfer, and pale-blooded ones also, such as
slugs, snails, scallops, shrimps, crabs, crayfish, and many others;
nay, even in wasps, hornets, and flies,I have, with the aid of a
magnifying glass, and at the upper part of what is called the
tail, both seen the heart pulsating myself, and shown it to many
others.

But in the pale-blooded tribes the heart pulsatas sluggishly
and deliberately, contracting slowly as in animals that are
moribund‚ a fact that may readily be seen in the snass, whose
heart will be found at the bottom of that orifice in the right side
of the body which is seen to be opened and shut in the course
os respiration, and whence saliva is disharged, the incision being
made in the upper aspect of the body, near the part which
corresponds with the liver.

This, however, is to be observed: that in winter and the
colder season, exsanguine animals, such as the snail, show
no pulsations; they seem rather to live after the manner of
vegetables, or of those other productione which are therefore
designated plant-animals.

It is also to be noted that 311 animals which have a heart,
have also auricles, or something analogous to auricles; and
further, that wherever the heart has a double ventricle there are
always two auricles present, but not otherwise. If you turn to
the production of the chick in ovo, however, you will find at
