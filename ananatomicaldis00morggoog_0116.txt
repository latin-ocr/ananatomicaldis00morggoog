sition oi vital spirits, supposes the blood to ooze through the
septum ol the beart from the right to the leit ventricle by certain
secret pores, and the air to be attracted from the lungs through
the great vessel, the pulmonary vein; and which consequently,
will have it, that there are numerous pores in the septum ol the
heart adapted l'or the transmission of the blood. But, by
Hercules, no such pores can be demonstrated‚ nor in lact do any
such exist. For the septum oi the beart is of a denset and more
compact structure than any portion oi the body, except the
hones aod sinews. But even supposing that there were foramina
or pores in this situation, how could one of the ventricles extract
anything from the other—the left, ag, obtain blood from the
right, when we see that both ventricles contract and dilate simul·
taneously? Why should we not rather believe that the right
took spirits irorn the leit, than that the lest obtained blood irom
the right ventricle, through these foramina? But it is certainly
mysterious and incongruous that blood should be supposed to be
most commodiously drawn through a set oi obscure or invisible
ducts, and air through periectly open passages, at one and the
same moment. And why, I ask, is recourse had to secret aod
invisible porosities, to uncertain and obscure channels, to explain
the passage oi the blood into the leit ventricle, when there is so
open a way through the pulmonary veios? Ι own it has always
appeared extraordinary to me that they should have chosen to
make, or rather to imagine, a way through the thick, hard, dense,
and most compact septum ol the heart, rather than take that by
the open pulmonary vein, or even through the lax, soit, and
spongy substance of the lungs at large. Besides, if the blood
could permeate the substance ol' the septum, or could he imbihed
lrom the ventricles, what use were there sor the coronary artery
and vein, branches oi which proceed to the septum itseli,to
supply it with nourishment? And what is especially worthy os
notice is this: is in the foetus, where everything is more lax and
soit, Nature saw herself reduced to the necessity of bringing the
blood srorn the right into the lest side ol the heartby tlre foramen

ovale, from the vena cava through the pulmonary vein, bow
should it be likely that in the adult she should pass it so com·
