To the
Most Serene and Invincible

cunutus

Of Great Britain, France, and Ireland,

KING: DEFENDER of the F AlTH.

MOST SERENE KING,

life, the principle of the whole, the Sun of their
Microcosm, that upon which all movement dependS,
from which all strength proceeds. The King in like

his World, the heart of the Commonwealth, whence
all power derives, all grace appears. What Ihave
here written of the movements of the heart I am the
more emboldened to present to your Majesty, accord-
ing to the Custom of the present age, because nearly
all things human are done after human examples and
many things in a King are after the pattern of the
heart. The Knowledge of his heart therefore will
not be useless to a King as embracing akind of Divine

example of his functions,-and it has ever been usual
