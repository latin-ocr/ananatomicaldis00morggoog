58 Of the Movement

If, on the contrary, the artery instead of the vein be com-
pressed or tied, you will observe the part between the obstacle
and the heart, and the heart itself, to become inordinately dis-
tended, to assume a deep purple or even livid colour, and at
length to be so much oppressed with blood that you will believe
it about to be choked; but the obstacle removed, all things
immediately return to their natural state in colour, size, and
im ulse.

have now been set before you, and you have had opportunity of
viewing the truth contended for with your own eyes in the heart.

have here to cite certain experiments, from which it

HAT this may the more clearly appear to everyone‚ Ι
T seems obvious that the blood enters a limb by the

arteries, and returns from it by the veins; that the
arteries are the vessels carrying the blood from the heart, and
the veins the returning channels of the blood to the heart3 that
in the limbs and extreme parts of the body the blood passes
either immediately by anastomosis from the arteries into the
veins, or mediately by the pores of the flesh, or in both ways, as
has already been said in speaking of the passage of the blood
through the lungs whence it appears manifest that in the circuit
the blood moves from that place to this place, and from that
point to this one; from the centre to the extremities, to wit ;
and from the extreme parts back again to the centre. F inally,
upon grounds of calculation, with the same elements as before,
it will be obvious that the quantity can neither be accounted for
by the ingesta, nor· yet be held necessary to nutrition.
The same thing will also appear in regard to ligatures, an
