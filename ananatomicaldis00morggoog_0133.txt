of the Heart and Blood. 3 5

The grand cause of doubt and error in this subject appears to
me to have been the intimate connection between the heart and
the lungs. When men saw both the pulmonary artery and the
pulmonary veins losing themselves in the lungs, of course it
became a puzzle to them to know how or by what means the
narntlrrneww ferramentum
(jalen, whose words, when writing against Erashtratus in regard
to the origin and use of the veios and the coction of the blood,
are the following z* ‘You will reply,’ he says, ‘that the effect is
so ; that the blood is prepared ln the liver, and is thence trans-
ferred to the heart to receive its proper form and last perfection;
a statement which does not appear devoid of reason; forno great
and perfect work is ever accomplished at a sIngle effort, or
receives its final polish from one instrument. But if this b'e
actually so, then show us another vessel which draws the abso-
lutely perfect blood from the heart, and distributes it as the
arteries¹ do the spirits over the whole body! Here, then, isa
reasonable opinion not allowed. because, forsooth, besides not
seeing the true means of transit, he could not discover the vessel
lwhich' should transmit the blood from the heart to the body at
arge. ’

But had anyone been there in behalf of Erasistratus, andos
that opinion which we now espouse, and which Galen himself
acknowledges in other respects consonant with reason, to have
pointed to the aorta as the vessel which distributes the blood
from the heart to the rest of the body, I wonder what would
have been the answer of that most ingenious and learned man?
Had he said that the artery transmits spirits and not blood, he
would indeed sufficiently have answered Erasistratus, who
imagined that the arteries contained nothing but spirits; but
then he would have contradicted himself, and given a foul denial
to that for which he had keenly contended in his writings
against this very Erasrstratus, to wit, that blood in substance
is contained in the arteries, and not spirits; a fact which he
