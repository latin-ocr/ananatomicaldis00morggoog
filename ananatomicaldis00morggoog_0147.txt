parts oi the heart m general, with many things besides, Ι sre-
quentlyand senously bethought me and long revolved ru my mind,
what might be the quantity os blood which was transmitted, m
how short a time its passage might be effected, and the like. l'3ut
not finding it possible that this could be supplied by the juices

of the ingested aliment without the veins on the one hand be-
coming drained, and the arteries on the other getting ruptured
through the excessive charge ol blood, unless the blood should
somehow find its way irom the arterias into the veins, and so
return to the right side ol the heart; 1 began to think whether
there might not be A MOVEMENT, AS ΙΤ WERE, IN A
CIRCLE. Now this Ι afterwards lound to be true3 and Ι finally
saw that the blood, forced by the action oi the leit ventricle into
the arteries, was distributed to the body at large, and its several
parts, in the same manner as it is sent through the lungs, im-
pelled by the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery, and that
it then passed through the veins and along the vena cava, and so
round to the left ventricle in themanner already indicated. This
movement we may be allowed to call circular‚ in the same way
as Arestotle says that the air and the rain emulate the circular
movement oi the superior bodies; sor the moist earth, warmed
by the sun, evaporates; the vapours drawn upwards are con·
densed, and descending in the form ol rain, moisten the earth
again. By this arrangement are generations oi living things
produced ; and in like manner are tempests and meteors engen-
deredgrathg circular movement, and by the approach and reces-
sron o e un.

And similarly does it come to pass in the body, through the
movement of the blood, that the various parts are nourished,
cherished, quickened by the warmer, more perfect, vaporous,

coagulated, and, so to sp eak, effeta. It then returns to its
sovereign the beart, as if to its source, or to the inmost home os
the body there to recover its state oi excellence or perlection.
Here rt renews its fluidity, natural heat, and becomes powersul,
iervid, a kind of treasury os lile, and impregnated with spirits,
