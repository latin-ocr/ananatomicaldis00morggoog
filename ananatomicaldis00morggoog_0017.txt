Accoiding to Auhrcy, Docron Hunvsv died in London but
the Harvey Genealogist states that it was at his brother’s house
at Roelampton. His remains were encased in lead and laid to
re6st in the family vault in Hcmpsteod Church on the zoth June,
1 .

ii January‚ 1882, the Tower of Hcmpstead Church collapsed;
and the further preservation of Docrou HnRvsv's remaius-
which were lying encased in their original lead cerements, in
the Harvey vault beneath the Church—was considered by the
College of Physicians and the family representatives. It was
at first proposed to re-inter them in Westminster Abbey be·
neath a thick glass plate. This idea was, however, aban-

October, 1883, in the presence of the family representative3‚ the
President, the Office bearers, and some of the Fellows of the
College of Physicians and the officiating Clergy‚ the remains were
reverenti transferred to their new, and it may be hoped, final
testing-place within the sarcophagus together with a copy of
pis works and a Roll recording the incidents of the Trans·
ation.

Docron Hunvnv's memory and has with particular and unusual
ability set forth his discovery and considered it in connection
with the views of preceding Physiologists. Docrou Hnnvnv's
Works, translated and edited by Docron When, were pub-
lished by the Sydeuham Society in the year 1847.
