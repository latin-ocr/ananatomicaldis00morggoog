32 Of the Movement

first no more than a vesicle or auricle, or pulsating drop of
blood ς it is only by and by, when the development has made
sorne progress, that the heart is fashioned: even so in certain
animals not destined to attain to the highest perfection in their
organization, such as bees, wasps‚ snails, shrimps, crayfish, θα,
we find only a certain pulsating vesicle, like a sort of red or
1wfhite palpitating point, as the beginning or principle of their
re.

We have a small shrimp in these countries, which is taken in

question there was a bloody point so small that it disappeared
during the contraction and escaped the sight, but in the relaxa·
tion it reappeared again, red and like the point of a pin; so that

ROM these and other observations of a similar nature, 1

heart is as follows:

First of all, the auricle contracta, and in the course of

its contractiori forces the blood, (which it contains in ample
