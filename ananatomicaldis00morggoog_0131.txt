of the Heart and blood. 3 3

quantity as the head of the veins‚ the stote-house and cistem of
the blood,) into the ventricle, which being filled, the heart raises
itself straightway, makes 311 its fibres tense, contracts the ven·
tricles, and performs a beat, by which beat rt immediately sends
the blood supplied to it by the auricle into the arteriesy. The
right ventricle sends its charge into the lungs by the vessel which
is called vena arteriosa, but which, rn structure and function,and
all other respects, is an artery. The left ventricle sends its
charge into the aorta, and through this by the arteries to the
body at large.

These two movements, one ol the ventricles‚ the other of the
auricles, take place consecutively, but in such a manner that
there is a kind of harmony or rhythm preserved between them,
the two concurring in such wise that but one movement is ap·
parent, especially in the warmer-blooded animale, in which the
movements in question are rapid. Nor is this for any other
reason than it is in a piece of machinery, in which, though one
wheel gives movement to another, yet all the wheels seem to
move simultaneously; or in that mechanical contrivance which
is adapted to firearms‚ where the trigger being touched, down
comes the flint, strikes against the steel, produces a spark, which
falling among the powder, ignites it, upon which the flame ex-
tends, enters the barrel, causes the explosion, propels the ball,
and the mark is attained-all of which incidents, by reason of
the celerity with which they happen, seem to take place in the
twinkling of an eye. So also in deglutition: by the elevation of
the root of the tongue‚ 3ηά the compression of the mouth, the
food or drink is pushed into the fauces, when the larynx is closed
by its muscles and by the epiglottis The pharynx is then raised
and opened by its muscles in the same way as a sac that is to
be filled rs lifted up, and its mouth dilated. Upon the mouthful
being received, itis forced downwards by the transverse muscles,
and then carried further by the longitudinal ones. Yet all these
movements, though executed by different and distinct organs,
are performed harmoniously, and rn such order, that they seem
to constitute but a single movement and act, which we call
deglutition„
