The First Pontion .· of the Quantity ry Blood passing
from tie Veins to tire Arteries. And that there is
a Circuit rysthe Blood, Freed from Objections, and
Furtlrer Corfirmedby Expertinena

O iar our first position is confirmed, whether the thing be
referred to calculation or to experiment and dissection,
via, that the blood is incessantly poured into the
arteries in larger quantities than it can be supplied by

the iood ; so that the whole passing over in a short space os
time, it is matter os necessity that the blood perform a circuit,
that it return whence it set out.

But is anyone shall here object that a large quantity may pass
through and yet no necessity be found sor a circulation, that all
may come irorn the meat and drink consumed, and quote as an
illustration the abundant supply os milk in the mamma-ior a
cow will give three, four, and even seven gallons and more in a
day, and awoman two or three pints whilst nursing a child or
twins, which must manifestly be derived from the sood consumed;
it may be answered‚ that the heart by computation does as much
and more in the course of an hour or two.

And il not yet convinced, he shall still insist, that when an
artery is divided, a pretematural route ie, as it were, opened, and
that so the blood escapes in torrents, but that the same thing
does not happen in the healthy and uninJured body when no
outlet is made; and that in arteries filled, or in their natural
state, so large a quantity of blood cannot pass in so shorta
space oi time as to make any return necessary ;-to all this it

may be answered‚ that from the calculation already made, and
