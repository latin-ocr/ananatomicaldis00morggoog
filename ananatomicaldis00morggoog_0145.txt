tinually permeating from the right to the lest ventricle, from the
vena cava into the aorta, through the porous structure oi the
lungs, plainly appears srom this, that since the blood is inces-
santly sent from the right ventricle into the lungs by the pul-
monary artery, and in like manner is incessantly drawn srom
the lungs into the lest ventricle, as appears from what precedes
and the position oi the valves‚ it cannot do otherwise than pass
through continuously. And then, as the blood is incessantly
flowing into the right ventricle ol the heart, and is continually
passed out from the leit, as appears in like manner, and as is
obvious both to sense and reason, itis impossible that the blood
can do otherwise than pass continually irom the vena cava into
the aorta.

Dissection consequently shows distinctly what takes place in
the majority oi animale, and indeed in all, up to the period oi
their maturity; and that the same thing occurs in adults is
equally certain, both from (jalen's words, and what has already
been said, only that in the former the transit is affected by open
and obvious passages, in the latter by the hidden porosities oi
the lungs and the minute inosculations ol vessels. lt therefore
appears that, although one ventricle os the heart, the left to wit,
would suffice sor the distribution os the blood over the body, and
its eduction from the vena cava, as indeed is done in those
creatures that have no lungs‚ Nature, nevertheless, when she
ordained that the same blood should also percolate the lungs, ,
saw herself obliged to add the right ventricle, the pulse os which
should force the blood from the vena cava through the lungs
into the cavity of the leit ventricle. In this way, it may be said
that the right ventricle is made sor the sake oi the lungs, and
ior the transmission oi the blood through them, not sor their
nutriti0n; ior it were unreasonable to suppose that the lungs
