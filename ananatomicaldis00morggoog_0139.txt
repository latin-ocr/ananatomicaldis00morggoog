, of the Heart and Blood. 41

ventricles3 the right one receiving the blood from the auricle,

and propelling it by the pulmonary artery, and its continuation,
named the ductus arteriosus, into the aorta; the left, in like
manner, charged by the contraction of its auricle, which has re·
ceived its supply through the foramen ovale from the vena cava,
contracting, and projecting the blood through the root¹ of the
aorta into the trunk of that vessel. ’

In embryos, consequeutly, whilst the lungs are yet in a state
of inaction, performing no function, subject to no movement any
more than if they had not been present, Nature uses the two
ventricles of the heart as if they formed but one, for the trans-
mission of the blood. The condition of the embryos of those
animals which have lungs, whilst these organa are yet in abeyance
{nd not pmployed, is the same as that of those animals which

ave no ungs.

So it clearly appears in the case of the foetus, that the heart
by its action transfers the blood from the vena cava into the
aorta, and that bya route as obvious and open, as if in the adult
the two ventricles were made to communicate by the removal
of their septum. We therefore lind thatin the greater number
of animals, in all, indeed, ata certain period of their existence,
the chanuels for the transmission of the blood through the heart

are conspicuous. But we have still to inquire why in some '

creatores—those, namely, that have warm blood, and that have
attained to the adult age, man among the number-we should
not conclude that the same thing is accomplished through the
substance of the lungs, which in the embryo, and at a time when
the function of these organs isin abeyance, nature effects by the
direct passages described, and which, indeed, she seems com-
pelled to adopt through want of a passage by the lungs; or why
it should be better (for Nature always does that which is best)
that she should close up the various open routes which she had
formerly made use of in the embryo and foetus, and still uses in
all other animale. Not only does she thereby open up no new
