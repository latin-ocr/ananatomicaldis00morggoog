lation is absolutely necessary, sceing that the quantities hinted
at cannot be supplied immediately from the ingesta, and are
vastly more than can be requisite lor the mere nutrition of the
arts.

p It is still further to be observed, that in practising phlebotomy
the truths contended for are sometimes confirmed in another
way ; for having tied up the arm properly, and made the puncture
duly, still, if from alarm or any other causes, a state of faintness
supervenes, in which the heart always pulsates more languidly,
the blood does not flow lreely, but distils by drops only. The
reason is, that with the somewhat greater than usual resistance
offered to the transit of the blood by the bandage, coupled with
lhe weaker action ol the heart, and its diminished impelling
power, the stream cannot make its way under the ligature; and
further, owing to the weak and languishing state of the heart,
the blood is not transferred in such quantity as wont from the
veins to the arteries through the sinuses of that organ. So also,
and for the same reasons, are the menstrual fluxes of women,
aud indeed hemorrhages of every kind, controlled. And now, a
contrary state os things occurring, the patient getting rid ol his
lear and recovering his courage‚ the pulse strength is increased,
the arteries begin again to beat with greater force, and to drive
the blood even into the part that is bound; so that the blood
now springs from the puncture in the vein, and flows in a con·
tinuous stream.

HUS lar we have spoken of the quantity of blood pass-

the body, and in like manner from the arteries into
the veins in the peripheral parts and the body at

large. We have yet to explain, however, in what manner the
