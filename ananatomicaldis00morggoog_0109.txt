of the Heart and iilood. 11

which are said to be contained in these vessels, at the same time,
since spirits are much more subtle than iuliginous vapours or
smoke? And ii the arteries take in and cast out air in the
systole and diastole, like the lungs in the process oi respiration,
why do they not do the same thing when a wound is made
in one os them, as in the operation oi arteriotomy? When the
windpipe is divided, it is sufficiently obvious that the air enters
and returns through the wound by two opposite movements; but
when an artery is divided, it is equally manifest that blood
escapes in one continuous stream, and that no air either enters or
issues. If the pulsations oi the arteries ian and refrigerate the
several parts ol the body as the lungs do the heart, how comes it,
as is commonly said, that the arteries carry the vital blood into
the different parts, abundantly charged with vital spirits, which
cherish the heat oi these parts, sustain thern when asleep, and
recruit them when exhausted? How should it happen that, if
you tie the arteries, immediately the parts not only become
torpid, and srigid, and look pale, but at length cease even to be
nourished? This, according to Galen, is because they are deprived
ol the heat which flowed through all parts from the heart, as its
source3 whence it would appear that the arteries rather carry
warmth to the parts than serve sor any lanning or refrigeration.
BesideS, how can their diastole draw spirits lrom the heart to
warm the body and its parts, and means ol cooling them from
without? Still l'urther, although some affirm that the lungs,
arteries, and heart have all the same offices, they yet maintain
that the heart is the workshop oi the spirits, and that the
arteries contain and transmit them; denying, however, in oppo-
sition to the opinion ol columbus, that the lungs can either
make or contain spirits. They then assert, with Galen, against
Erasistratus, that it is blood, not spirits, which is contained in the
arteries.

These opinions are seen to be so incongruous and mutually
subversive that every one ol them is justly brought under
suspicion. That it is blood and blood alone which is contained
in the arteriasis made manifest by the experiment ol (jalen, by
arteriotomy, and by wounds; ior lrom a single divided artery, as
