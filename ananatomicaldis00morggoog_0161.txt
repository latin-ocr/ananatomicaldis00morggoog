should it be otherwise? Heat and pain and a vacuum draw,
indeed; but 10 such wise only that parts are filled, not preter·
naturally distended or gorged, and not so suddenly and violently
overwhelmed with the charge 01 blood lorced in upon them, that
the flesh is lacerated and the vessels ruptured. Nothing 01 the
kind as an effect 01 heat, or pain, or the vacuum 10100, is either
credible or demonstrable.

Resides, the ligature is competent to occasion the afflux in
question without either pain, 01 heat, or a vacuum. Were pain
in any way the cause, how should it happen that, with the arm
bound above the elboW, the hand and fingers should swell below
the bandagc. and their veins become distended? The pressure
01 the bandage, certainly prevents the blood irom getting there by
the veins.. And then, wheresore is there neither swelling nor
repletion 01 1110 veins, nor any sign or symptom 01 attraction or
afflux, above the ligature? But this is the obvious cause 01 the
preternatural attraction and swelling below the bandage, and in
the hand and fingere, that the blood is entering abundantly, and
with lorce, but cannot pass out again.

Now is not this the cause ol all tumefaction, as indeed
Auiccnna has it, and 01 all oppressive redundancy in parts, that
the access to them is open, but the egress irom them is closed?
Whence it comes that they are gorged and tumefied. And may
not the same thing happen in local inflammations, where, so
long as the swelling is on the increase, and has 001 reached its
extreme term, a lull pulse is 1011 10 the part, especially when the
disease is ol the more acute kind, and the swelling usually takes
place most rapidly. But these are matters 101 alter discussion.
Or does this, which occurred 10 my own case, happcn from the
same cause Thrown 11010 a carriage upon one occasion,I
struck my lorehead a blow upon the place where a twig 01 the
artery advances from the temple, and immediately, within the
time in which twenty beats could have been made, l 1011 a
tumour the size 01 an egg developed, without either heat or any
great pain; the near vicinity 01 the artery had caused the blood
101 be eilused into the bruised part with unusual lorce and
ve ocity.
