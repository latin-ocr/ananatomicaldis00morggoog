What is commonly said ln regard to these two great communi·
cations, to wit, that they exist sor the nutrition ol the lungs, is
both improbable and inconsistent; seeing that in the adult they
are closed up, abolished, and consolidated, although the lungs,
by reason oi their heat and movement, must then be presumed
to require a larger supply ol nonrishment. The same may be
said in regard to the assertion that the heart in the embryo does
not pulsate, that it neither acts nor moves, so that nature was
forced to make these communications ior the nutrition ol the
lungs. This is plainly ialse; ior simple inspection oi the in-
cubated egg, and ol embryos just taken out oi the uterus, shows
that the heart moves in them precisely as in adults‚ and that
nature ieels no such necessity. 1 have myself repeatedly seen
these motions, and Arr'stotle is lilrewise witness oi their reality.
‘The pulse,’ he observes, ‘inheres in the very constitution oi the
heart, and appears irom the beginning, as is learned both from
the dissection of living animals and the formation ol the chick
in the egg’* But we further observe, that the passages in ques-
tion are not only pervious up to the period ol birth in man, as
well as in other animab, as Anatomists in general have described
them, but sor several months subsequently, in some indeed sor
several years, not to say for the whole course of lile ; as, ior
example, in the goose, snipe, and various birds, and many oi the
smaller animals. And this circumstance it was, perhaps, that
imposed upon Botallus, who thought he had discovered a new
passage for the blood from the vena cava into the lelt ventricle
of the heart; and l own that when 1 met with the same arrange-
ment in one ol the larger members oi the mouse iamily, in the

ailult state, 1 was myself at first led to something ol a like con·
c usion.

From this it will be understood that in the human embryo,
and in the embryos oi animals in which the communications are
not closed, the same thing happens, namely, that the heart by
its movement propels the blood by obvious and open passages
from the vena cava into the aorta through the cavities ol both the
