of the Heort ond Blood. 21

chid and calumniated me, and laid it to me as acrime that I had

dated to depart frorn the precepts and opinion of all Anatomists;
others desired further explanations of the novelties, which they
said were both worthy of consideration, and might perchance be
found of signal use. At length, yielding to the requests of my
friends, that all might be made participators in my labours, and
partly moved by the envy of others, who, receiving my views
with uncandid minds and understanding thern indifferently, have
essayed to traduce me publicly,I have been moved to commit
these things to the press, in order that all may be enabled to
form an opinion both of me and my labours. This step 1 take
all the more willingly, seeing that Hieronymus Fabricius of
Aquapeudente, although he has accurately and learnedly de-
lineated almost every one of the several parts of animals in a
special work, has left the heart alone untouched. Finally, if any
use or benefit to this department of the republic of letters should
accrue from my labours, it will, perhaps, be allowed that 1 have
not lived idly, and, as the old man in the comedy says:

FOR never yet hoth anyoue attoined

To such perfidiore, but that time, andplace,
And use, have brought addition to his knowledge ,·
Or made correctrim, or admouished him,
That he was ignorantes much which he
Had thought he knew ; or led him to reject
What he had once esteemed os highest pn’ce.

So will it, perchance, be found with reference to the heart at this
time; or others, at least, starting hence, with the way pointed
out to them, advancing under the guidance of a happier genius,
may make occasion to proceed more fortunately, and to inquire
more accurately.
