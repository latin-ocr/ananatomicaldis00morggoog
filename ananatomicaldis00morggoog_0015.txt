Prefatory Memoir. vii

annual delivery of a solemn Oration in commemoration of those
who had been Benefactors to the college. This Oration, now
known as the Commemorative oration, is still annually de·
livered on St. Luke’s Day when Docron Hnnvnv's work and
memory are affectionately revered. At the recent Oration
delivered by Doctor uiuum-Bronton, it was shown how
Docnon HAnvnv’s discovery still lives and works, and that from
his idea of the Circulation, had grown all modern ideas of
disease and the mode and action of drugs.

Of Docuon Hirvnv's personal appearance and disposition
we have the testimony of his friend Jonu Aussnav who thus
describes him: ‘He was not tall, but of the lowest stature*
‘round seced, olivaster (like wainscot) complexion, little eie,
‘ round, very black, full of spirit, his baire was black as araven,
‘but quite white twenty years before he died. . . . In temper
‘he was like his brothers, very choleric, and in his younger
‘days he wore a dagger, as the fashion then waS, whicb- he
‘would be apt to draw out upon every occasion ’—though it is
not recorded that he ever did so to an one’s injury.—In visit-
ing his patients he ‘rode on horsebacl with a font-cloath, his
‘man following on foot, as the fashion then was, which was
‘ve decent, now quite discontinued. The judges rode also
‘wit the oot·cloathes to Westminster Hall. . . . He was
‘ always very contemplative and was wout to frequent the leads
‘of Cockainehouse, which his brother Eliab had bought,
‘having there his several stations in regard to the sun and the
‘wind, for the indulgence of his fancy . . . he had caves made
‘in the ground, in which he delighted in the summer time to
‘meditate' He also loved darkness, saying that be could then
better contemplate.

ὓ ln the face of this evidence it is strange to see the incongruens Statue of
' ' Docrok Hanvnv, which was erected on the Folkestone Lens in the year
1881. ln this Statue he is represented as of colossal size, standing withalarge

ἢ he'art in his lest hand, from which theventricles are seen protruding‚ resem-

bling in their size and appearance the ends of iron gas-pipes: while his
right hand is extended as if in the act of demonstrating his views. The

stainei-guse windov to his memory which was placed in Folkestone Churcb
is amuch more pleasing memorial.
