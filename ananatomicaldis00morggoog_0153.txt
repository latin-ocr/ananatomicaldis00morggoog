of the Heart and Blood. 5 5

usually find so large a quantity ol blood in the veins, so little in
the arteries; why there is much in the right ventricle‚ little in
the leit, which probably led the ancients to believe that the
arteries (as their name implles) contained nothing but spirits
during the liie oi an animal. Perhaps the true cause oi the dii·
ierence is this, that as there is no passage to the arteries, save
through the lungs and heart, when an animal has ceased to
breathe and the lungs to move, the blood in the pulmonary
artery is prevented from passing into the pulmonary veins, and
from thence into the lest ventricle os the heart; just as we have
already seen the same transit prevented in the embryo, by the
wantos movement in the lungs and the alternate opening and
closing oi their minute orifices and invisible pores. But the
heart not ceasing to act at the same precise moment as the
lungs, but surviving them and continuing to pulsate ior a time,
the lest ventricle and arteries go on distributing their blood to
the body at large and sending it into the veins; receiving none
irom the lungs, however, they are soon exhausted, and leit, as it
were, empty. But even this lact confirms our views, in no trifling

manner, seeing that it can be ascribed to no other than the cause ·

we have just assumed.

Moreover it appears from this that the more frequently or
sorcibly the arteries pulsate, the more speedily will the body be
exhausted ol its blood during hemorrhage. Hence, also, it
happens, that in sainting fits and in states oi alarm, when the
beart beats more languidly and less sorcibly‚ hemorrhages are
diminished and arrested.

Still further, it is from this, that aiter death, when the heart
has ceased to beat, it is impossible bydividing either the jugular
or iemoral veins and arteries, by any effort to force out more
than one hals oi the whole mass os the blood. Neither could
the butcher ever bleed the carcass effectually did he neglect to
cut the throat os the ox which he has knocked on the head and
stunned‚ before the heart had ceased beating.

F inally, we are now in a condition to suspect whereiore it is
that no one has yet said anything to the purpose upon the anas·
tomosis os the veins and arteries, either asto where or how it is
