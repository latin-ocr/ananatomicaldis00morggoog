the heart, such as toads, frogs, serpents, and lizards, which have
lungs in a certain sense, as they have a voice. Ι have many
observations by me on the admirable structure of the lungs of
these animale, and matters appertaining, which, however, 1
cannot introduce in this place. Their anatomy plainly shows
us that the blood is transferred in them from the veins to the
arteries in the same manner as in higher animals, vis„ by the
action of the heart; the way, in fact, is patent, open, manifest ;
there is no difficulty, no room for doubt about it; for in them
the matter stands precisely as it would in man, were the septum
of his heart perforated or removed, or one ventricle made out of
two; and this being the case, 1 imagine that no one will doubt
as to the way by which the blood may pass from the veins into
the arteries.

But as there are actually more animals which have no lungs
than there are furnished with them, and in like manner a greater
number which have only one ventricle than there are with two,
it is open to us to conclude, judging from the mass or multitude
of living creaturos, that for the major part, and generally, there
is an open way by which the blood is transmitted from the
veins through the sinuses or cavities of the heart into the
arteries.

Ι have, however, cogitating with myself, ,seen further, that the
same thing obtained most obviously in the embryos of those
animals that have lungs; for in the foetus the four vessels belong-
ing to the heart, uris, the vena cava, the pulmonary artery, the
pulmonary vein, and the great artery or aorta, are all connected
otherwise than in the adult; afact sufficiently known to every
Auatomist. The first contact and uuion of the vena cava with
the pulmonary veins, which occurs before the cava opens properly
into the right ventricle of the heart, or gives off the coronary

vein, a little above its escape from the liver, is by a lateral
anastomosis; this is an ample foramen of an oval form, com-
municating between the cava and the pulmonary vein, so that the
blood is free to flow in the greatest abundance by that foramen
from the vena cava into the pulmonary vein, and left auricle, and
from thence into the left ventricle. Further, in this foramen
