And now, too, we understand why in phlebotomy we apply
our ligature above the part that is punctured, not below it; did
the flow come from above, not from below, the constriction in
this case would not only be of no service, but would prove a
positive hinderance; it would have to be applied below the
orifice, in order to have the flow more free, did the blood
descend by the veins from superior to inferior parts ; but as it is

elsewhere forced through the extreme arteries into the extreme
veinS, and the return in these last is opposed by the ligature, so
do they fill and swell, and being thus filled and distended, they
are made capable of projecting their charge with force, and to a
distance, when any one of thern is suddenly punctured ; but the
ligature being slackened, and the returning channels thus left
open, the blood forthwith no longer escapes, save by drops;
and, as all the world knows, if ,in performing phlebotomy the
bandage be either slackened too much or the limb be bound too
tightly, the blood escapes without force, because in the one cusu
the returning chaunels are not adequatcly obstructed; in the
other the chaunels of influx, the arteries, are impeded.

F these things be so, another point which I have already
referred to, viz, the continual passage of the blood through
the heart will also be confirmed. We have seen, that the
blood passes from the arteries into the veins, not from the

veins into the arteries3 we have seen, further, that almost the
whole of the blood may be withdrawn from a puncture made in
one of the cutaneous veins of the arm if a bandage properly
applied be used ; we have seen, still further, that the blood llows
so freely and rapidly that not only is the whole quantity which
was contained in the arm beyond the ligature, and before the
