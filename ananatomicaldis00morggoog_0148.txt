50 Of the Movement

it might be said with baisam. Thence it is again dispersed.
All this depends on the movement and action os the beart

The beart, consequently, is the beginning oi lise; the Sun os
the Microcosm, even as the Sun in histum might well be
designated the beart os the World ; lor it is the heart by whose
virtue and pulse the blood is moved, perfected, and made
nutrient, and is preserved from corruption and coagulation ; it is
the household divinity which, discharging its fonction, nourishes,
cherishes, qnickens the whole body, 'and is indeed the foundation
os lise, the source oi all action. Butos these things we shall speak

Hence since the veins are the conduits and vessels that trans-
port the blood, they arc ol two kinds, the cava and the aorta3
and this not by reason ol there being two sides oi the body, as
Anktotle has it, but because of the difference os office, not, as is
commonly said, in consequence os any diversity ol structure, sor
in many animals, as Ι have said, the vein does not differ from
the artery in the thickness of its walls, but solely in virtue ol
their distinct fonctions and uses. A vein and an artery, both
styled veins by the ancients, and that not without reason, as
(jalen has remarked, sor the artery is the vessel which carries
the blood irum the beart to the body at large, the vein of the
present day bringing it back from the general system to the
beart ; the former is the conduit from, the latter the channel to,
the heart3 the latter contains the cruder, effete blood, rendered

unfit ior nutrition; the former transmits the digested, perfect,
peculiarly nutritive fluid.
