To his very dear Friend

DOCTOR ARGENT‚
TheExcellent and Accomplished
President of the Royal College
of Physicians, and to other
Learned PhysicianS, his most

esteemed Colleagues
I HAVE already and repeatedly presented you, my

learned friends, with my new vtews of the movement

and function of the heart, in my anatomical lectures;
but having now for nine years and more confirmed these
views by multiplied demonstrations in your presence, illus-
trated them by arguments, and freed them from the objec-
tions of the most learned and skilful Anatomists, 1 at length
yield to the requests, 1 might say entreaties, of many, and
here present them for general consideration in this Treatise.

Were not the work indeed presented through you, my
learned friends,l should scarcely hope that it could come
out scatheless and complete3 for you have been in general,
the faithful witnesses of almost all the instances from which
1 have either collected the truth or confuted error. You
have seen my dissectione, and at my demonstrations of all
that 1 maintain to be objects of sense, you have been accus-
tomed to stand byend confirm me with your testimony. And
