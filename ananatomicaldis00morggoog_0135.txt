INCE the intimate connection of the heart with the lungs,
which rs apparent in the human subject, has been the
probable cause=os the errors that have been committed
on this point, they plainly do amiss who, pretending to

speak oi the parts os animals generally, as Anatomists for the
most part do, confine their researches to the human body alone,
and that when it is dead. They obviously do not act otherwise
than he who, having studied the lorms ol a single commonwealth,
should set about the composition os a general system os polity;
or who, having taken cognizance oi the nature ol a single field,
should imagine that he had mastered the science oi agriculture ;
or who, upon the ground ol one particular proposition, should
proceed to draw general conclusions.

Had Anatomists only been as conversant with the dissection
ol the lower animals as they are with that ol the human body,
the matters that have hitherto kept them in a perplexity os
doubt would, in my opinion, have met them freed lrom every
kind os difficulty.

And first, in fishes, in which the heart consists ol but a single
ventricle, being devoid oi lungs, the thing is sufficiently manifest.
Here the sac, which is situated at the base os the heart, and is
the part analogous to the auricle in man, plainly lorces the
blood into the heart, and the heart, in its turn, conspicuously
transmits it by a pipe or artery, or vessel analogous to an artery;
these are facts which are confirmed by simple ocular inspection,
as well as by a division of the vessel, when the blood is seen to
be projected by each pulsation oi the heart.

The same thing is also not difficult ol demonstration in those
animala that have, as it were, no more than a single ventricle to
