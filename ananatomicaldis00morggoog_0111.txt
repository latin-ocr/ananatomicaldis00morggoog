systole of the two is also concurrent, there is another incongruity.
For how can two bodies mutually connected, which are simul·
taneously distended‚ attract or draw anything from one another ;
or, being simultaneously contracted, receive anything from each
other? And then, it seems impossible that one body can thus
attract another body into itself, so as to become distended, seeing
that to be distended is to be passive, unless, in the manner of a
sponge, which has been previously compressed by an external
force, it is returning to its natural state. But it is difficult to
conceive that there can be anything of this kind in the arteries.
The arteries dilate, because they are filled like bladders or
leathern bottles; they are not filled because they expancl like
bellows. This I think easy of demonstration. and indeed con·
ceive that 1 have already proved it. Nevertheless, in that book
of Galen headed ‘Quod Sanguis continetur in Arteriis,' he
quotes an experiment to prove the contrary: An artery having
been exposed, is opened longitudinally, and a reed or other
pervious tube is inserted into the vessel through the opening by
which the blood is prevented from being lost, and the wound is
closed. ‘So long,’ he says, ‘as things are thus arranged, the
whole artery will pulsate ; but if you now throwa ligature about
the vessel and tightly compress its walls over the tube, you will
no longer see the artery beating beyond the ligature’ Ι have
never performed this experiment of Galen's, nor do l think that
it could very well be performed in the living body, on account of
the profuse flow of blood that would take place from the vessel
which was operated on; neither would the tube effectually close
the wound in the vessel without a ligature; and Ι cannot doubt
but that the blood would be found to flow out between the tube
and the vessel. Still Galen appears by this experiment to prove

both that the pulsative property extends from the beart by the
walls of the arteries, and that the arteries, whilst they dilate, are
filled by that pulsific force, because they expand like bellows, and
do not dilate as if they are filled like skins. But the contrary is
obvious in arteriotomy and in wounds; for the blood spurting
from the arteries escapes with force, now further, now not so far,
alternately, or in jets3 and the jet always takes place with the
