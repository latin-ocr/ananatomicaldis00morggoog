could be iurnished in no other way than by making a circuit and
ret'lllllntgruth indeed, presents itseli obviously before us when we

consider what happens in the dissection oi living animals; the
great artery need not be divided, but avery small branch only,
(as Galen even proves in regard to man), to have the whole of
the blood in the body, as well that oi the veins as ol the arteries,
drained away in the course ol no long time-some half honr or
less. Butchers are well aware ol the lact and can bear witness
to it; sor, cutting the throat oi an ox and so dividing the vessels
ol the neck, in less than a quanter oi an hour they have all the

vessels bloodless-the whole mass oi blood has escaped¹ The ·

same thing also occasionally occurs with great rapidity in per-
iorbming amputations and removing tumours in the human
su ject-

Nor would this argument lose any of its force, did anyone
say that in killing animals in the shambleS, and performing
amputations, the blood escaped in equal, is not perchance in
larger quantity by the veins than by the arteries. The con-
trary oi this statement, indeed, is certainly the truth ; the veins,
in lact, collapsing, and being without any propelling power, and
lurther, because ol the impediment os the valves, as I shall show
immediately, pour out but very little blood ; whilst the arteries
spirt it iorth with soree abundantly, impetuously, and 'as ii· it

in the neck oi a sheep or dog, when it will be seen with what
lurce, in what abundance, and how quickly, the whole blood in
the body, oi the veins as well as oi the arteries is emptied. But
the arteries receive blood from the veins in no other way than
by transmission through the heart, as we have already seen3 so
that ii the aorta be tied at the base oi the heart, and the carotid
or any other artery be opened, no one will now be surprised to
find it empty, and the veins only replete with blood.

And now the cause is manifest, why in our dissections we
