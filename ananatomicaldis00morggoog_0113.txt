1. Why, I ask, when we see that the structure oi both ventricles

is almost identical, there being the same apparatus oi fibres, and '

braces, and vairos, and vessels, and aurieles, and each in the same

their uses be imagined to be different, when the action, move·
ment, and pulse oi both ar! the same? Il the three tricuspid
valves placed at the entrance into the right ventricle prove
obstacles to the reflux oi the blood into the vena cava, and is the
three semilunar valves which are situated at the commencement
ol the pulmonary artery be there, that they may prevent the
return os the blood into the ventricle; why, when we find similar
structores in connection with the leit ventricle, should we deny
that they are there ior the same end, oi preventing here the egress,
there the regurgitatioh os the blood?

2. And again, when we see that these structures, in point ol'
size, sorm, and situation, and almost in every respect the same in
the leit as in the right ventricle, why should it be said that things
are arranged in the former ior the egress and regressos spirits,
in the latter or right ventricle, ior the blood? The same arrange-
ment can tbe held fitted to favour or impede the motion oi
blood a os spirits indifferently.

3. And when we observe that the passages and vessels are
severally in relation to one another in point os size, viz, the pul·
monary artery to the pulmonary veins, why should the one be
destined to a private purpose, that os nourishing the lungs, the
other to a public functioni

quantity oi blood should be required sor the nutrition oi the
lungs3 the vessel that leads to thern, the vena arteriosa or
pulmonary artery being oi greater capacity than both the iliac
veios?
