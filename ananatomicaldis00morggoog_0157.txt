of the Heart and Blood. 59

wherelore they are said to draw,· though this is neither from
the heat, nor the pain, nor the vacuum they occasion, nor indeed
irom any other cause yet thought 01 ; it will also explain the
uses and advantages to be derived irom ligatures 10 medicine,
the principle upon which they either suppressor occasion hemor-
rhage; how they induce sloughing and more extensive mortifi-
cation in extremities; and how they act in the castration 01
animale and the removal 01 warts and lleshy tumours. But it
has come to pass, from no one having duly weighed and under-
stood the causes and rationale 01 these various etiects, that
though almost all, upon the saith 01 theold writers, recommend
ligatures in the treatment 01 discase, yet very lew comprehend
their proper employment, or derive any real assistance lrom them
in effecting cures.

Ligatures are either very tight or 01 medium tightness. A
ligature I designate as tight or perfect when it so constricts an
extremity that no vessel can be ielt pulsating beyond it. Such
a ligature we use in amputations to control the flow 01 blood3
and such also are employed in the castration 01 animals and the
ablation 01 tumours. In the latter instances, all afflux 01 nutri-
ment and heat being prevented by the ligature, we see the testes
and large fleshy tumours dwindle, die, and finally lall 011.

Ligatures 01 medium tightness I regard as those which com·
press a limb firnrly all round, but short 01 pain, and in such a
way as still suffers a certain degree 01 pulsation to be ielt in the
artery beyond them. Such a ligature is in use 10 blood-letting,
an operation which the fillet applied above the elbow is not
drawn so tight but that the arteries at the wrist may still be iclt
beating under tho finger.

Now let anyone make an experiment upon the arm 01 a man,
either using such a fillet as is employed 10 blood-letting, or
grasping the limb lightly with his hand, the best subject ior it
being one who is lean, and who has large veins, and the best

time aster exercise, when the body is warm, the pulse is 1011, and

the blood carried 10 larger quantity to the extremities, sor all

then is more conspicuous ; under such circumstances let a liga·

ture be thrown about the extremity, and drawn as tightly as can
