viii Prefatory Memoir.

The best portrait of Docron HAnva is believed to be that
by Junsen at the Royal College of Physicians; and it is regret-
table that permission to reproduce it for this work-which is
of so much interest in connection with him who was so great a
Benefactor to, and so illustrious a Fellow of, the College-—was
withheld. The Portrait prefixed to this volume is from that in
the National Portrait Gallery‚ which was once the property of
, Docron Meno, and has been twice engraved: it is a pleasing
and an authentic likeness.

As Docron Hanvev advanced in years he did not practise
his profession except in special cases. He appears to have been
generally free from physical infirmity3 but towards the end of
his life he was much afflicted with the gout, though at the close,
his transition through Death was easy and his great spirit
passed away on the evening of the 3rd of June, 1657, within ten
months of his eightieth birthday.

After Docron Hanvev’s death there was a rumour that he
had ended his struggles by taking opium, which his friend
Aubrey very strongly denies, and says ‘It is now fitt and but
‘just that I should endeavour to undeceive the world in a
‘scandal that I find strongly runnes of him, w⁰¹¹I have mett
‘amongst some learned young men, viz„ that he made himself
‘ away, to putt himself out of his paine by opium 3 not but that,
‘had he laboured under great paines‚ he had been readie
‘enough to have donne it; I do not deny that it was not
‘according to his principles on certain occasions to . . . [sic]
‘but the manner of his dyeing was really and houd fide thus,
‘viz., the morning of his death about 10 o'clock‚ he went to
‘speake‚ and found he had the dead palsey in his tongue3 then
‘he sawe what was to become of him, he knew there was then
‘no hopes of his recovery‚ so presently sends for his young
‘nephews to come up to him to whom he gives one his watch
‘ ('twas a minute watch with which he made his experiments)‚
‘to another, another remembrance, dc, made sign to . ..
