diastole ol the artery, never with the systole. By which it clearly
appears that the artery is dilated by the impulse of the blood3
sor ol itself it would not throw the blood to such a distance, and
whilst it was dilating; it ought rather to draw air into its cavity
through the wound, were those things true that are commonly
stated concerning the uses ol' the arteries. Do not let the thiclr·
ness ol' the arterial tunics impose upon us, and lead us to conclude
that the pulsative property proceeds along them srom the heart,
' For in several animals the arteries do not apparently differ irorn
the veins; and in extreme parts oi the body, where the arteries

⁴ are minutely subdivided, as in the braio, the hand, θα, no one

could distinguish the arteries from the velus by the dissimilar
characters os their coats; the tunics of both are identical. And
then, in an aneurism proceeding from a wounded or eroded
artery, the pulsation is precisely the same as in the other arteries‚
and yet it has no proper arterial covering. To this the learned
Riolanus testifies along with me, in his Seventh Book.

Nor let anyone imagine that the uses os the pulse and the
respiration are the same, because, under the influence ol the same
causes, such as running, anger, the warm bath, or any other
heating thing, as Galen says, they become more frequent and
iorcible together. For, not only is experience in opposition to
this idea, though (jalen endeavours to explain it away, when we
see that with excessive repletion the pulse beats more lorcibly,
whilst the respiration is diminished in amount; but in young
persons the pulse is quiclr, whilst respiration is slow. So it is
also in alarm, and amidst care, and under anxiety of mind ; some-
times, too, in severs, the pulse is rapid, but the respirationis
slower than usual.

These and other objections os the same kind may be urged
against the opinions mentioned. Nor are the views that are
entertained of the offices and pulse ol the heart, perhaps, less '
bound up with great and most inextricable difficulties. The
heart, it is vulgarly said, is the lountain and workshop oi the vital
spirits, the centre from whence lifc is dispensed to the several
parts ol the body. Yet it is denied that the right ventricle makes
spirits, which is rather held to supply nourishment to the lungs.
