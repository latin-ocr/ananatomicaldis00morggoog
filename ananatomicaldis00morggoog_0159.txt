ofrhe Heart and Blooal. 61

From these facts it is easy for every eareful observet to learn
that the blood enters an extremity by the arteries; for when
they are effectually compressed nothing is drawn to the member ;
the hand preserves its colour; nothing flows into it, neither is it
distended ; but when the pressure is diminished, as it is with the
bleeding fillet, it is manifest that the blood is instantly thrown
in with force, for then the hand begins to swell; which is as
much as to say, that when the arteries pulsate the blood is
flowing through them, as it is when the moderately tight ligature
is applied; but where they do not pulsate, as, when a tight
ligature is used, they cease from transmitting anything, they are
only distended above the part where the ligature is applied.
The veins again being compressed, nothing can flow through
them ; the certain indication of which is, that below the ligature
they are much more tumid than above it, and than they usually
appear when there is no bandage upon the arm.

lt therefore plainly appears that the ligature prevents the
return of the blood through the veins to the parts above it, and
maintains those beneath it in astate of permanent distension.
But the arteries in spite of its pressure, and under the force and
impulse of the heart, send on the blood from the internal parts
of the body to the parts beyond the ligature. And herein con-
sists the differenee between the tight and the medium ligature,
that the former not only prevents the passage of the blood in the
veinS, but in the arteries also ; the latter, however, whilst it does
not prevent the force of the pulse from extending beyond it, and
so propelling the blood to the extremities of the body, eom-
presses the veins, and greatly or altogether impedes the return
of the blood through them.

Seeing, therefore, that the moderately tight ligature renders
the veins turgid and distended, and the whole hand full of blood,
Ι ask, whence is this? Does the blood accumulate below the
ligature coming through the veins, or through the arteries‚ or
passing by certain hidden pores? Through the veins it cannot
come; still less canit come through any system of invisible
pores; it must needs then, arrive by the arteries‚ in conformity
with all that has been already said. That it cannot flow in by
