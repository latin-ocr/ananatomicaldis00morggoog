of the Heart and Blood. 51

Chapter IX.

Ther there is a Circulattbn ofthe Blood is Confirmed
from the First Proposition.

UT lest anyone should say that we give them words
only, and make mere specious assertione without any
foundation, and desire to innovate without sufficient
cause, three points present themselves for confirmation,

which being stated, Ι conceive that the truth 1 contend for will
follow necessarily, and appear asa thing obvious to all. F irst,
-the blood is incessantly transmitted by the action of the heart
from the vena cava to the arteries in such quantity that it cannot
be supplied from the ingesta, and in such a manner that the
whole must very quickly pass through the orgau; Second-the
blood under the influence of the arterial pulse enters and is im·
pelled in a continuous, equable‚ and incessant stream through
every part and member of the body, in much larger quantity
than were sufficient for nutrition, or than the whole mass of fluids
could supply; Third,-theveins in like manner return this blood
incessantly to the heart from parts and members of the body.
These points proved, Ι conceive it will be manifest that the
blood circulates‚ revolves, propelled and then returning, from the
heart to the extremities, from the extremities to the heart, and
thus that it performs a kind of circular movement.

Let us assume either arbitrarily or from experiment, the
quantity of blood which the left ventricle of the heart will con-
tain when distended, to be, say two ounces, three ounces, otone
ounce and a half-in the dead body I have found it to hold
upwards of two ounces. Let us assume further, how much less
the heart will hold in the contracted than in the dilated state;
and how much blood it will project into the aorta upon each
contraction ;-and all the world allows that with the systole
something is always projected, a necessary consequence demon·

strated in the third chapter, and obvious from the ;truzcture of
