be cut off with a pair oi scissors, you will perceive the blood
flowing out upon each contractiora ol the auricles. Whence it is
manifest that the blood enters the ventricles, not by any attrac-
tion or dilatation oi the heart, but by being thrown into them by
the pulses ol the auricles.

And here I would observe, that whenever Ι speak oi pulsa-
tions as occurring in the auricles or ventricles, I mean contrac-
tions: first the auricles contract, and then and subsequently the
heart itseli contracta. When the auricles contract they are seen
to become whiter, especially where they contain but little blood ;
but they are filled as magazines or resevoirs oi the blood, which
is tending spontaneously and, by its movement in the veins, under
pressure towards the centre; the whiteness indicated is rnost
conspicuous towards the extremities or edges oi the auricles at
the time oi their contractione

In fishes and frogs, and other animala which have hearts with
but a single ventricle, and ior an auriele have a kind oi bladder
much distended with blood, at the base oi the organ, you may
very plainly perceive this bladder contracting first, and the con-
traction oi the beart or ventricle following afterwards.

But 1 think it right to describe what 1 have observed of an
opposite character: the heart oi an eei, oi several fishes, and
even oi some [os the higher] animale taken out ol the body,
pulsates without auricles; nay, is it be cut in pieces the several
parts may still be seen contracting and relaxing; so that in
these creatures the body oi the heart may be seen pulsating and
palpitating, after the cessation oi all movement in the auricle. But
is not this perchance peculiar to animals more tenacious oi life,
whose radical moisture is more glutinous, or iat and sluggish,
and less readily solublei The same faculty indeed appears in
the flesh ol eels, which even when skinned and embowelled, and
cut into pieces, are still seen to move.

Experimenting with a pigeon upon one occasion, aiter the
heart had wholly ceased to pulsate, and the auricles too had
become motionless,l kept my finger wetted with saliva and
warm ior a short time upon the heart, and observed, that under

the influence oi this fomentation it recovered new strength and
