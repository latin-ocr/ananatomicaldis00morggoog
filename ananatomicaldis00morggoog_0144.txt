think it would be looked upon as no trifle, &c.’ Shortly aiter·

wards be says: ‘And then a third inconvenience, by no means
to be thought lightly 01, would sollow, were the blood moved
backwards during the expirations, had not our Maker instituted
those supplementary membranes.' Whence in tbe eleventh
chapter, he concludes: ‘That they (the valves) bave all a common
use, and that it is to prevent regurgitation or backward move·
ment; each, however, having a proper 10001100, tbe one set
drawing matters from the beart, and preventing their return, tbe
other drawing matters into the beart, and preventing their escape
1το01 11. For Nature never intended to distress 1110 110οτ1 with
needless labour, 001111οτ10 bring augbt into the organ which it
bad been better to bave kept away, nor to take from it again
augbt which it was requisito should be brought. Since, then,
there are sour orifices in all, two in either ventricle, one 01 tbese
induces, tbe other educes! And again he says: ‘Furtber, since
there is one vessel, wbicb consists 01 a simple covering im-
planted in the beart, and another, wbicb is double, extending
1το111 11, (Galen is here speaking 01 1110 right side 01 1110 110οτ1,
but 1 extend his observatione to tbe leit side also,) a kind 01
reservoir had to be provided, to which both belonging, the blood
should bc drawn in by 000, and emittcd by tbe otber.'

This argument (jalen adduces 1οτ 1110 transit 01 the blood by
the right ventricle frorn the vena cava into the lungs; but we
can use it witb still greater propriety, merely changing tbe terms,
1011110 passage 01 1110 blood from the veins through the beart into
the arteries. From Galen, however, that great man, that Father
01 Physic, it clearly appears tbat the blood passes through the
lungs frorn the pulmonary artery into the minute branchos 01
the pulmonary veins, urged to tbis both by the pulses 01 1110
beart and by the movements 01 the lungs and thorax; that the
beart, moreover, is incessantly receiving and expelling tbe blood
by and 1το111 its ventricles, as· t'rom a magazine or cistern, and 1οτ
this end it is lurnished with 10οτ sets 01 valves, two serving 1οτ
the induction and two 1οτ tbe eduction 01 1110 blood, lest, like the
Euripus, it should be incommodiously sent bitber and thither, or
flow back into the cavity wbicb it should bave quitted, or quit tbe
