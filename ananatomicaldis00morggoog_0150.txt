the valves; and let us suppose as approaching the truth that
the fourth, or fifth, or sixth, or even but the eighth part of its
charge ‚is thrown into the artery at each contraction; this would
give either hall an ounce, or three drachms, or one drachm os
blood as propelled by the heart at each pulse into the aorta3
which quantity, by reason ol the valves at the root os the vessel,
can by no means return into the ventricle. Now in the course
ol hall an bour, the heart will have made more than one thousand
beats, in some as many as two, three, and even four thousand.
Multiplying the number of drachms propelled by the number
ol pulses, we shall have either one thousand hals ounces, or one
thousand times three drachms, or a like proportional quantity
os blood, according to the amount which we assume as propelled
with each stroke of the heart, sent from this organ into the
artery; a larger quantity in every case thanis contained in the
whole bodyl In the same way, in the sheep or dog, say that
but a single scruple os blood passes with each stroke ol the heart,
in one hali bour we should have one thousand scruples, or about
three pounds and a hall ol blood injected into the aorta; but
the body ol neither animal contains above four pounds os blood,
a fact which I have mysell ascertained in the case of the sheep.

Upon this supposition‚ therefore, assumed merely as a ground
t'or reasoning, we see the whole mass ol blood passing through
the heart, from the veins to the arteries, and in like manner
through the lunge.-

But let it be said that this does not take place in halt an
hour, but in an hour, or even in a day ; any way it is still mani-
fest that more blood passes through the heart in consequence of
its action, than can either be supplied by the whole os the
ingesta, or than can be contained io the veins at the same mo-
ment.

Nor can it be allowed that the heart in contracting sometimes
propels and sometimes does not propel, or at most propels but
very little, a mere nothing, or an imaginary something: all this,
indeed, has already been reluted, and is, besides, contrary both
to sense and reason. For is it bea necessary effect ol the
dilatation ol the heart that its ventricles become filled with
