puncture was made,discharged, but the whole which is contained
in the body, both that oi the arteries and that oi the veins.

Whence we must admit, first, that the blood is sent along with
an impulse, and that it is urged with force below the ligature;
ior it escapes with iorce, which force it receives from the pulse
and power oi the heart; ior the soree and movement ol the blood
are derived irom the heart alone. Second, that the afflux pro·
ceeds from the beart, and through the heart bya course from
the great veins; ior it gets into the parts below the ligature
through the arteries, not through the velns; and the arteries
nowhere receive blood irorn the veinS, nowhere receive blood
save and except irom the leit ventricle oi the heart. Nor could
so large a quantity oi blood be drawn frorn one vein (a ligature
having been duly applied), nor with such impetuosity, such
readiness, such celerity, unless through the medium ol the im·
pelling power oi the heart. .

But ii all things beas they are now represented, we shall feel
ourselves at liberty to calculate the quantity oi the blood, and to
reason on its circular movement. Should anyone, lor instance,
in perlorming phlebotomy, suffer the blood to flow in the manner
it usually does, with force and ireely, lor some hali hour or so,
no question but that the greatest part oi the blood being ab·
stracted, saintings and syncopes would ensue, and that not only
would the arteries but the great veins also be nearly emptied oi
their contente. lt is only consonant with reason to conclude
thatin the course os the hali hour hinted at, so much as has
escaped has also passed from the great veins through the heart
into the aorta And further, ii we calculate how many ounces
flow through onc arm, or how many pass in twenty or thirty
pulsations under the medium ligature, we shall have some
grounds ior estimating how much passes through the other arm
in the same space oi time: how much through both lower
extremities, how much through the neck on either side, and
through all the other arteries and veins os the body, all oi which
have been supplied with sresh blood, and as this blood must have
passed through the lungs and ventricles ol the heart, and must
have come from the great veios—we shall perceive that a circu·
