of the Heart and Blood. 45

inosculation of the arteries with the veins, and they severally
transmit both blood 3ηά spirit, by certain invisible and un-
doubtedly very narrow passages. Now if the mouth of the
pulmonary artery had stood in like manner continually open,
and Nature had found no contrivance for closing it when requisite,
and opening it again, it would have been impossible that the
blood could ever have passed by the invisible and delicate mouths,
during the contractions of the thorax, into the arteries; for all
things are not alike readily attracted or repelled3 but that which
is light is more readily drawn in, the instrument being dilated,
3ηά forced out again when it is contracted, than that which is
heavy; and in like manner is anything drawn more rapidly along
an ample conduit‚ 3ηά again driven forth, than it is through a
narrow tube. But when the thorax is contracted‚the pulmonary
veins, which are in the lungs, being driven inwardly‚ and power·
fully compressed on every side, immediately force out some of
the spirit they contem, 3ηά at the same time assume 3 certain
portion of blood by those subtle mouths; a thing that could
never come to pass were the blood at liberty to flow back into
the heart through the great orifice of the pulmonary artery. But
its return through this great opening being prevented, when it is
compressed on every side, a certain portion of it distils into the
pulmonary veins by the minute orifices mentioned! And shortly
afterwards, in the very next chapter, he says: ‘The more the
thorax contraets, the more it strives to force out the blood, the
more exactly do these membranes (viz, the semilunar valves)
close up the mouth of the vessel, and suffer nothing to regurgi-
tate.' The same fact he has also alluded to in a preceding part
of the tenth chapter: ‘Were there no valves, 3 three-[old incon-
venience would result, so that the blood would then perform this
lengthened course in vain ; it would llow inwards during the
diastoles of the lungs, and fill all their arteries; but in the
systoles, in the manner of the tide, it would ever and anon, like
the Euripus, flow backwards 3ηά forwerds by the same way,
withareciprocating move'ment,which would nowise suit the blood.
This, however, may seem a matter of little moment; but if it

meantime appear that the function of respiration suffer, then Ι
