 

of the Heart and Blood. 43

Chapter VII.

The Blood posses through the Substance of the Lungr

srom the Right Ventricle ofthe Heart into the Pul·
monary Veins and lest V entricle.

HAT this is possible, and that there is nothing to pre-
T vent it lrom being so, appears when we reflect on the

way in which water permeating the earth produces

springs and rivulets, or when we speculate 00 the
means by which the sweat passes through the sirio, or the urine
through the substance 01 the kidneys. It is well known that
persons who use the Spa waters, or those 01 La Madouna, in
the territories 01 Padua, or others 01 an acidulous or vitriolated
nature, or who simply swallow drinks by the gallon, pass all 011
again within an hour or two by the bladder. Such a quantity
01 liquid must take some short time 10 the concoction: it must
pass through the liver; it is allowed by all that the juices 01 the
sood we consume pass twice through this orgen in the course 01
the day; it must flow through the veins, through the tissuc 01
the kidneys, and through the ureters into the bladder.

To those, therefore, whom Ι hear denying that the blood, aye,
the whole mass 01 the blood may pass through the substance 01
the lungs, even as the nutritive juices percolate the liver, assert-
ing such a proposition to be impossible, and by no means to be
entertained as credible, 1 reply, with the poet, that they are 01
that race 01 men who, when they will, assent lull readily, and
when they will not, by 00 manner 01 means ; who, when their
assent is wanted, sear, and when it is not, sear not to give it.

The substance 01 11ιο liveris extremely dense, so is that 01
the kidney; the lungs, however, are 01 a much looser texture,
and 11 compared with the kidneys are absolutely spongy. In
the liver there is no forcing, 00 impelling power; in the lungs
the blood is forced 00 by the pulse 01 the right ventricle, the

necessary effect ol whose impulse is the distension 01 6tlt-e vessels
