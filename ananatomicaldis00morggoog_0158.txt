60 Of the Movement

be borne it will first be perceived that beyond the ligature,
neither in the wrist nor anywhere else, do the arteries pulsate, at
the same time that immediately above the ligature the artery
begins to rise higher at each diastole, to throb more violently,
and to swell in its vicinity with a kind os tide, as il it strove to
break through and overcome the obstacle to its current; the
artery here, in short, appears as il it were preternaturally lull.
The hand under such circumstances retains its natural colour
and appearance; in the course ol time it begins to sall somewhat
in temperature, indeed, but nothing is drawn into it.

After the bandage has been kept on lor some short time in
this way, let it be slackened a little, brought to that state or
term os medium tightness which is used in bleeding, and it will
be scen that the whole hand and arm will instantly become
deeply coloured and distended, and the veins show themselves
tumid aud knotted ; alter ten or twelve pulses ol the artery, the
hand will be perceived excessively distended‚ injected, gorged
with blood, drawn, as it is said, by this medium ligature, without
pain, or heat, or any horror os a vacuum, or any other cause yet
indicated.

Is the linger be applied over the artery as it is pulsating by
the edge ol the fillet, at the moment of slackening it, the blood
will be felt to glide through, as it were, underneath the finger3
and he, too, upon whose arm the experiment is made, when the
ligature is slackened, is distinctly conscious ol a sensation ol
warmth, and of something, vra, a stream ol blood suddenly
making its way along the course ol the vessels and diffusing itsell

through the hand, which at the same time begins to leel hot, and
becomes distended.

As we have noted, in connection with the tight ligature, that
the artery above the bandage was distended and pulsated, not
below it, so, in the case ol the moderately tight bandage, on the
contrary, do we find that the veins below, never above, the fillet,
swell, and become dilated, whilst the arteries shrink; and such
is the degree ol distension ol the veins here, that it is only very
strong pressure that will force the blood beyond the tillet, and
cause any of the veins in the upper part ol the arm to rise.
