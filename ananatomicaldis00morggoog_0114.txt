movement, and the vessel that supplies them is oi such dimensions,
what is the use or meaning oi the pulse oi the right ventricle?
and why was Nature reduced to the necessity ol' adding another
ventricle sor the sole purpose os nourishing the lunge?

When it is said that the left ventricle draws materials sor the
formation os spirits, air, and blood, from the lungs and right
sinuses ol the heart, and in like manner sends spirituous blood
into the aorta, drawing fuliginous vapours thence, and sending
them by the pulmonary veins into the lunge, whence spirits are
at the same time obtained sor transmission into the aorta, I ask
how, and by what means, is the separation effected? And how
comes it that spirits and iuliginous vapours can pass hither and
thither without admixture or confusioni Il the mitral cuspidate
valves do not prevent the egressos iuliginous vapours to the
lungs, how should they oppose the escape os air? And how
should the semilunars hinder the regressos spirits from the aorta
upon each supervening diastole os the heart? Above all, how
can they say that the spirituous blood is sent from the pulmonary
veins by the lest ventricle into the lungs without any obstacle to
its passage irorn the mitral valves‚ when they have previously
asserted that the air entered by the same vessel from the lungs
into the left ventricle, and have brought iorward these sarne
mitral valves as obstacles to its retrogression ἓ Good God! how
should the mitral valves prevent the regurgitation os air and not
ol blood?

Moreover, when they attribute the pulmonary artery, a vessel oi
great size, with the coverings ol an artery, to none but a kind os
private and single purpose, that, narnely, oi nourishing the lungs,
why should the pulmonary vein, which is scarcely so large, which
has the coats ot a vein, and is solt and lax, be presumed to be
made ior many—three or four, different uses? For they will

have it that air passes through this vessel from the lungs into the
left ventricle ; that iuliginous vapours escape by it srorn the heart
into the lungs; and that a portion oi the spirituous blood is
distributed to the lungs sor their relreshment.

Is they will have it that furnes and air-fumes flowing from,
air proceeding towards, the heart-are transmitted by the same
