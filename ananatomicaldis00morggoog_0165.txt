blood finds its way back to the heart from the extremities by the
A veins, and how and in what way these are the only vessels that
convcy the blood from the external to the central parts; which
done,I conceive that the three fundamental propositions laid
down for the circulation of the blood will be so plain, so well
established, so obviously true, that they may claim general

credence. Now the remaining position will be made sufficiently
clear from the valves which are found in the cavities of the veins
themselves, from the uses of these, and from experiments cog·
nizable by the senses.

The celebrated Hieronymus Fabricius of Aquapendente,a most
skilful Anatomist, and venerable old man, or, as the learned
Riolan will have it, Jacobus Silvius, first gave representations of
the valves in the veins, which consist of raised or loose portions
of the inner membranes of these vessels, of extreme delicacy,
and a sigmoid or semilunar shape. They are situated at dif-
ferent distances from each other, and diversely in different indi-
viduals; they are connate at the sides of the veins; they arc
directed upwards or towards the trunks of the veins; the two-
for there are for the most part two together-regard each other,
mutually touch, and are so ready to come into contact by their
edges. that if anything attempt to pass from the trunks into the
branches of the veins, or from the greater vessels into the less,
they completely prevent it; they are further so arranged, that
the horns of those that succeed are opposite the middle of the
convexity of those that precede, and so on alternately.

The discoverer of these valves did not rightlyunderstand their
use, nor have succeeding Anatomists added anything to our
knowledge: for their office is by no means explainedwhen we
are told that it is to hinder the blood, by its weight, from all
flowing into inferior parts; for the edges of the valves in the ’
jugular veins hang downwards‚ and are so contrived that they
prevent the blood from rising upwards; the valves, in a word, do
not invariably look upwards, but always towards the trunks of
the veins,invariably towards the seat of the heart. 1, and indeed
others, have sometimes found valves in the emulgent veins, and
in those of the mesentery, the edges of which were directed

97².
