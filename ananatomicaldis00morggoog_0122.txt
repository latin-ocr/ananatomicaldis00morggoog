[and the shock is given], is emptied. Whence the movement

' which is generally regarded as the diastole of the heart, is in

truth its systole. And in like manner the intrinsic movement os
the heart is not the diastole but the systole ; neither is it in the
diastole that the heart grows firm and tense, but in the systole,
fortheri only, when tense, is it moved and made vigorous.
Neither is it by any means to be allowed that the heart only
moves in the line of its straight fibres, although the great
Vesalius, giving this notion countenance, quotes a bundle of
osiers bound in a pyramidal heap in illustration ; meaning, that
as the apex is approached to the base, so are the sides made to
bulge out in the fashion of arches, the cavities to dilate, the
ventricles to acquire the form of a cupping-glass and so to suck
in the blood. But the true effect of every one of its libres is to
constringe the heart at the same time that they render it tense ;
and this rather with the effect ol thickening and amplilying the
walls and substance of the organ than enlarging its ventricles.
And, again, as the fibres run srorn the apex to the base, and draw
the apex towards the base, they do not tend to make the walls
os the heart bulge out in circles, but rather the contrary; inas·
much as every fibre that is circularly disposed, tends to become
straight when it contracts ; and is distended laterally and
thickened, as in the caseos muscular fibres in general, when
they contract, that is, when they are shortened longitudinally, as
we see thern in the bellies‘of the muscles of the body at large.
To all this let it be added, that not only are the ventricles con-
tracted in virtue of the direction and condensation of their walls,
but further, that those fibres, or bands, styled nerves byArrlrtotle,

, which are so conspicuous in the ventricles os the larger animals,

and contain all the straight libres, (the parietes os the heart con·
taining only circular ones) when they contract simultaneously,
by an admirable adjustment all the internal surfaces are drawn
together, as if with cords‚ and so is the charge of blood expelled
with force.

Neither is it true, as vulgarly believed, that the heart by any
dilatation or movement os its own, has the power of drawing the
blood into the ventricles3 for when it acts and becomes tense,
